This is a writeup for most forensics challenges from TexSAW CTF 2024. Checking out their forensics challenges, I was very satisfied with them. Most of the challenges were very well made and the admins were chill in giving sanity checks. Shame I was busy with my internship duties so I could not try out the OSINT and Misc challenges.

## Malicious Threat [Forensics]
Question: In the wake of recent security breaches, it has become paramount to ensure the integrity and safety of our systems. A routine audit of our admin activity logs has revealed several anomalies that could suggest a breach or an attempted breach. These logs are critical to understanding the actions taken by users with administrative privileges and identifying any that could have jeopardized our network's security. Your task is to analyze the provided admin activity logs to identify any suspicious activities.

Flag: `texsaw{g0tcha_fl@g_m1ne}`

We are given a log file to investigate. This was pretty guessy but just find a GET request to a suspicious website where a zip file can be downloaded.

![log1](/assets/posts/texsawctf2024/log1.png)

![log2](/assets/posts/texsawctf2024/log2.png)

The flag can be found in one of the CSV file, specifically `users.csv`.

```
└─$ cat * | grep texsaw      
"2024-02-26 10:35:00 - Admin User 3 texsaw{g0tcha_fl@g_m1ne} - FAILED"
```

## The Forked Cave [Forensics]
Question: A party of adventurers ventured into a dangerous cave, but forgot to bring in their handy partyflag.txt that gives them buffs. In the end all but one died, as she was rescued by a strange knight. The party's flag was torn to shreds outside the cave.

Flag: `texsaw{git_g00d_or_git_d3ath}`

We are given a zip file to investigate. Inside the zip file were several text files and a hidden `.git` folder.

```
└─$ ls -la
total 14
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4096 Mar 23 12:51 .
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4096 Mar 25 00:11 ..
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4096 Oct 19  2018 .git
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root   30 Oct 19  2018 knight.txt
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root   37 Mar 20 12:00 partyflag.txt
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root   37 Oct 19  2018 priestess.txt
```

Using [GitTools](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools), the flag can be extracted.

```

## MFMFT [Forensics]
Question: I stole my boss' flash drive. Rumor has it that he keeps the password to the payroll database fragmented across the filenames of the contents of his USB drive. I have a segment of the Master File Table here - can you help me figure out the password? I would like to give myself a 200% raise. Oh, this might help: [0, 10, 17, 18, 5, 6, 15, 13, 9, 16, 12, 5, 11, 1, 14, 5, 7, 6, 7, 3, 2, 2, 10, 8, 4, 7]. Wrap what you find with texsaw{}! If the password is password, enter texsaw{password}.

Flag: `texsaw{34sy_brEezY_MFT_7b7f224587}`

We are given a MFT artifact to investigate. So I parsed it with [MFTECmd](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/MFTECmd) and analyzed it on Timeline Explorer. Using the array given, we can obtain the flag according to the filenames using the entry number. However, since Timeline Explorer starts with 1 instead of 0, the entry numbers should be x+1 where we will take the file in entry 1 for 0, file in entry 11 for 10 and so on.

## Lightning [Forensics]
Question: McQueen got into a crazy crash and seemed to forget some of the places he has visited. See if you can jog his memory. Flag will be the names of all places, all lowercase, with no spaces or underscores, wrapped between the brackets of texsaw{}.

> Hint: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxU-a6UAEdg

Flag: `texsaw{daytonainternationalspeedwaymonzafujispeedwaynewhampshiremotorspeedwaywigwammotel}`

We are given broken parts of a Lightning McQueen picture. Checking their metadata, we can find GPS coordinates.

So I checked each coordinates and the locations can be found. After getting the locations, I have to format it properly where the picture parts matter. So it should be `alldiesel.jpg > supercar.jpg > piston.jpg > queen.jpg > champ.jpg` or in another words `daytonainternationalspeedway > monzacircuit > fujispeedway > newhampshiremotorspeedway > wigwammotel`. However, the flag was still incorrect. I checked the metadata again and realized the `Creator` entry mentioning how many words were required. So `monzacircuit` was actually just `monza`.

## MalWhere? [Forensics]
Question: You are a malware analyst and your manager has tasked you to conduct an investigation on malware that penetrated your organization’s network. Figure out what the file is doing by using your skills in static analysis (examining the malware sample without running or executing the code) or dynamic analysis (studying the behavior of the malware sample) in a closed, isolated virtual environment.

> Hint: The file is NOT actually malware, but your Antivirus and/or Windows Defender may think it is. The file is using functions that are commonly seen in malware, which is why your antivirus will likely automatically quarantine it. For that reason, disabling your antivirus may be required to complete this challenge. It is completely okay to not feel comfortable turning off your antivirus for an unreputable CTF hosted on the internet. If you do not feel comfortable disabling your antivirus on your host system, please setup a sandboxed Windows environment, disable the antivirus on there, and then solve the challenge. Here are some references if you'd like to learn how to setup a sandboxed Windows Environment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPsxy9JF8FM & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbLQnUVEHuE

Flag: `texsaw{p0wErSuRgE}`

We are given a supposedly malicious malware. Reading the hint, it seems that dynamic analysis was required so I booted up the malware on my Windows VM. Checking the malware on VirusTotal and Any.Run, a suspicious powershell command was executed.

```
"C:\Windows\syswow64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -noni -nop -w hidden -c &([scriptblock]::create((New-Object System.IO.StreamReader(New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream((New-Object System.IO.MemoryStream(,[System.Convert]::FromBase64String('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'))),[System.IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Decompress))).ReadToEnd()))

In the Windows VM, I used Procmon to find the powershell process and saw a `txt.galf` file was dropped. The flag can be found within the file.
