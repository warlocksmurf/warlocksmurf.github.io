This is a writeup for all forensics challenges from BITSCTF 2024. This was my first CTF that I managed to solve every forensics challenge solo. Despite the organizers having backlash for their explicit content in the forensics challenges, I still enjoyed the challenges due to how realistic it was. Hope the organizers learnt their lesson and improve next year.

## Scenario [Forensics]
> DFIR or Digital Forensics and Incident Response is a field within cybersecurity that focuses on the identification, investigation, and remediation of cyberattacks. Here are the types of analysis you can expect throughout these sequence of challenges!

### Intro to DFIR [Forensics]
**Question:** There are a total of 7 DFIR challenges, including this. The above linked files are to be used for all of them. Submitting this flag BITSCTF{DFIR_r0ck55} will unlock the subsequent challenges for the category. Lets see what happened with MogamBro :(

**Flag:** `BITSCTF{DFIR_r0ck55}`

We are given a memory dump, AD1 image file and PCAP file to investigate. The flag is provided in the description.

### Access Granted! [Forensics]
**Question:** First things first. MogamBro is so dumb that he might be using the same set of passwords everywhere, so lets try cracking his PC's password for some luck.

**Flag:** `BITSCTF{adolfhitlerrulesallthepeople}`

Using hashdump plugin to analyze the memory dump, the NTLM hashes can be extracted and cracked to obtain MogamBro's password.

### 0.69 Day [Forensics]
**Question:** MogamBro was using some really old piece of software for his daily tasks. What a noob! Doesn't he know that using these deprecated versions of the same leaves him vulnerable towards various attacks! Sure he faced the consequences through those spam mails. Can you figure out the CVE of the exploit that the attacker used to gain access to MogamBro's machine & play around with his stuff.

**Flag:** `BITSCTF{CVE-2023-38831}`

Analyzing the AD1 image, several suspicious files can be identified within the  Download folder.

![dfir3](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir3.png)

Analyzing the suspicious ZIP file, It seems to be concealing the activation of malicious code within an archive masquerading file formats and craft a weaponized archive. While researching on this specific attack, I stumbled about this [blog](https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/winrar-0-day-that-uses-poisoned-jpg-and-txt-files-under-exploit-since-april/) that talks about a WinRAR zero-day last year. Going through the AD1 image, the user seem to have WinRAR downloaded, suggesting that WinRAR was indeed the vulnerable software.

### I'm wired in [Forensics]
**Question:** MogamBro got scared after knowing that his PC has been hacked and tried to type a SOS message to his friend through his 'keyboard'. Can you find the contents of that message, obviously the attacker was logging him!

**Flag:** `BITSCTF{I_7h1nk_th3y_4Re_k3yl0991ng_ME!}`

Analyzing the AD1 image again, I noticed a keylog.pcapng file and a key file in the user's Desktop.

![dfir5](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir5.png)

Analyzing the PCAPng file, several USB packets can be identified. Researching online about USB packets, I found this [blog](https://medium.com/@sidharthpanda1/usb-sniffer-packet-challenge-cryptoverse-ctf-forensics-c42f2975e8f1) that mentioned about parsing HID data from the USB packets to extract the specific keystrokes. Following the blog, I added HID data as a column and exported the packets to a CSV file.

![dfir6](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir6.png)

The HID data can then be extracted from the CSV file and decoded using tools like [PUK](https://github.com/syminical/PUK).
```
cat hiddata.csv | cut -d "," -f 7 | cut -d "\"" -f 2 | grep -vE "HID Data" > hexoutput.txt

0200000000000000
02000c0000000000
0200000000000000
0000000000000000
00002c0000000000
0000000000000000
00000b0000000000
...
```

### Bypassing Transport Layer [Forensics]
**Question:** The exploit not only manipulated MogamBro's secret but also tried to establish an external TCP connection to gain further access to the machine. But I don't really think he was able to do so. Can you figure out where the exploit was trying to reach to?

**Flag:** `BITSCTF{5te4l1ng_pr1v47e_key5_ez:)}`

Analyzing the Powershell history, the user can be seen setting up environment variables for logging SSL/TLS keys, then it captures network traffic and saves the data into the PCAP file given by the authors.

![dfir8](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir8.png)

Remembering I had a SSL key log file extracted from the Desktop previously, I could use it to decrypt the TLS packets.

![dfir9](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir9.png)

Importing the key file to the PCAP file, the TLS packets can be successfully decrypted. Looking through the TLS traffic, several HTTP2 packets can be identified. So, I exported the HTTP2 data and found out it was just explicit images and some other text files (bruh 18+).

![dfir11](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir11.png)

![dfir12](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir12.png)

However, I knew the flag was somewhere in here. So I just used grep to obtain the flag.

![dfir13](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir13.png)

Edit: After awhile, the authors gave a hint on finding the flag where we should focus on pastebin only instead of the explicit stuff.

![dfir14](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir14.png)

### Lottery [Forensics]
**Question:** Now that you know the CVE, figure out how the attacker crafted the payload & executed it to compromise the 'secret'.

**Flag:** `BITSCTF{1_r3c3ived_7h3_b0mbz}`

Analyzing the PDF file within the ZIP file in the Downloads folder, it seems to be a batch script which executes `lottery.exe`, opens up Chrome in incognito mode to a Pastebin URL, opens up both notepad.exe and secret.png.enc, and finally downloads the content of google.com as a file named 'steps.pdf'

![dfir16](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir16.png)

Analyzing `lottery.exe` on VirusTotal, it was identified to be packed with PyInstall which can be unpacked using [pyinstxtractor](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor).

![dfir17](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir17.png)

Within the extracted libraries and dependencies, `lottery.pyc` can be identified and decompiled using [uncompyle6](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/uncompyle6-builds).

![dfir18](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir18.png)

![dfir19](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir19.png)

Reading the decompiled source code, it basically generates a random key in binary form and placed into a temporary file to be used for AES encryption.

```python
import os, tempfile
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad

def generate_key():
    key = os.urandom(32)
    fp = tempfile.TemporaryFile(mode='w+b', delete=False)
    fp.write(key)
    return key

def encrypt_file(file_path, key):
    iv = b'urfuckedmogambro'
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as (file):
        data = file.read()
        padded_data = pad(data, AES.block_size)
        cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
        encrypted_data = cipher.encrypt(padded_data)
    file.close()
    encrypted_file_path = file_path + '.enc'
    with open(encrypted_file_path, 'wb') as (encrypted_file):
        encrypted_file.write(encrypted_data)
    os.remove(file_path)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    key = generate_key()
    file_path = 'secret.png'
    encrypt_file(file_path, key)
    print('Dear MogamBro, we are fucking your laptop with a ransomware & your secret image is now encrypted! Send $69M to recover it!')
```

Checking the Temp folder in the AD1 image, the key file can be identified to be `tmpd1tif_2a` since the key was 32 bytes.

![dfir20](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir20.png)

Since the key was generated in binary form, it has to be converted to hex first before decryption. After having the key and IV, we can decrypt the 'secret' file and obtained the flag.

### MogamBro's guilty pleasure [Forensics]
**Question:** MogamBro was spammed with a lot of emails, he was able to evade some but fell for some of them due to his greed. Can you analyze the emails & figure out how he got scammed, not once but twice!

****Flag:**** `BITSCTF{sp4m_2_ph1sh_U}`

Analyzing the AD1 image, two suspicious email files can be found in the Outlook directory located in Documents.

![dfir24](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir24.png)

The email `YOU WON A LOTTERY!` had no relevant information since its just a phishing email to drop the suspicious ZIP file previously. However, the other email had some suspicious text which could be a flag.

Researching online about this, this [GIAC paper](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiE_7rprbCEAxXYXGwGHfNGCYcQFnoECBAQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.giac.org%2Fpaper%2Fgsec%2F1461%2Fsteganography-real-risk%2F102743&usg=AOvVaw2B7I64siMt2cjebgs5sTwR&opi=89978449) mentioned that the spam text was actually encoded using a method called SpamMimic.

![dfir25](/assets/posts/bitsctf2024/dfir25.png)

Decode the SpamMimic text, the flag can be obtained.
