This is a writeup for some forensics, networking and steganography challenges from KnightCTF 2024. Unfortunately, this was the first CTF I didn't enjoy due to the restrictive 10-attempts flag submission feature, which hindered progress on some challenges. I genuinely hope CTFs avoid implementing this feature in the future.

## Scenario [Forensics]
> My boss, Muhammad, sent me this dump file of a memory. He told me that this OS has a malware virus that runs automatically. I need to find some more information about this OS, and the hacker also created some files in this OS. He gave me a task to solve this within 24 hours. I am afraid. Will you please help me? My boss sent some questions; please solve them on my behalf. There are total 7 challenges in this series. Best of luck.

### OS [Forensics]
**Question:** What is the OS version?

**Flag:** `KCTF{7.1.7601.24214}`

Use WinDBG with the command `!analyze -v`.

### IP Addr [Forensics]
**Question:** What is the IP address of this system?

**Flag:** `KCTF{10.0.2.15}`

Use WinDBG with the command `du poi(poi(srvnet!SrvAdminIpAddressList))` with `du` commands to load each line.

### Password [Forensics]
**Question:** What is the login password of the OS? 

**Flag:** `KCTF{squad}`

Use hashdump plugin to get the password hashes.

### Note [Forensics]
**Question:** My boss has written something in the text file. Could you please help me find it? 

**Flag:** `KCTF{Respect_Y0ur_Her4nki}`

Dump the suspicious text file located in the Documents folder and analyze its file content for the flag.

![forensics7](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/forensics7.png)

### Execution [Forensics]
**Question:** My leader, Noman Prodhan, executed something in the cmd of this infected machine. Could you please figure out what he actually executed? 

**Flag:** `KCTF{W3_AR3_tH3_Kn1GHt}`

Use consoles plugin to find the command executed.

![forensics8](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/forensics8.png)

### Path of the Executable [Forensics]
**Question:** What is the path folder of the executable file which execute privious flag? 

**Flag:** `KCTF{C:\Users\siam\Documents}`

Use consoles plugin to find the path of the executable file.

### Malicious [Forensics]
**Question:** What is the malicious software name? 

**Flag:** `KCTF{MadMan.exe}`

Use autoruns plugin to find the suspicious software.

## Scenario [Networking]
> Recently one of Knight Squad's asset was compromised. We've figured out most but need your help to investigate the case deeply. As a SOC analyst, analyze the pacp file & identify the issues.

### Vicker IP [Networking]
**Question:** What is the victim & attacker ip?

**Flag:** `KCTF{192.168.1.8_192.168.1.7}`

Analyzing the traffic, the attacker `192.168.1.7` was sending multiple requests to our server `192.168.1.8`.

![network1](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/network1.png)

### Basic Enum [Networking]
**Question:** What tool did the attacker use to do basic enumeration of the server? 

**Flag:** `KCTF{nikto}`

Analyzing packets from either the attacker or server, Nikto logs can be identified.

![network2](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/network2.png)

### Vulnerable Service [Networking]
**Question:** What service was vulnerable to the main server?

**Flag:** `KCTF{vsftpd_2.3.4}`

Analyzing the FTP packets, it is shown that vsFTPd 2.3.4 was being exploited.

![network3](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/network3.png)

### CVE ID [Networking]
**Question:** What's the CVE id for the vulnerable service?

**Flag:** `KCTF{CVE-2011-2523}`

Just research online about vsFTPd 2.3.4 exploits.

![network4](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/network4.png)

### Famous Tool [Networking]
**Question:** The attacker used a popular tool to gain access of the server. Can you name it?

**Flag:** `KCTF{metasploit}`

Just research online about CVE-2011-2523, several videos show Metasploit being used to gain initial access.

![network5](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/network5.png)

### PORT [Networking]
**Question:** What was the port number of the reverse shell of the server?

**Flag:** `KCTF{6200}`

Just research online about CVE-2011-2523, it mentioned that port 6200 was exploited.

![network6](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/network6.png)

### Hidden File [Networking]
**Question:** What's the flag of the hidden file?

**Flag:** `KCTF{ExPloItiNg_S3RvEr_Is_fUN}`

The flag was identified in one of the packets, however, I could not decode it before the CTF ended.

![network7](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/network8.png)

The method was apparently "Twin Hex" which is super guessy since this is an uncommon encoding method.

![network9](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/network9.png)

### Confidential [Networking]
**Question:** There's something confidential. Can you find it?

**Flag:** `KCTF{Y0U_Ar3_N3tW0rk_M1n3r}`

Extracting a suspicious ZIP file from the PCAP, a docx file could be obtained from it. Analyzing the docx file, the flag was hidden beneath an image.

![network10](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/network10.png)

![network12](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/network12.png)

### BackDoor [Networking]
**Question:** What is the backdoor file name?

**Flag:** `KCTF{.621b4CkD0oR.php5}`

A PHP file can be identified being created and renamed in one of the packets.

![network13](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/network13.png)

### BackDoor Path [Networking]
**Question:** What is the full path of the backdoor in the server?

**Flag:** `KCTF{/var/www/html/app/assets/.621b4CkD0oR.php5}`

Just take the full path of the PHP file.

## Oceanic [Steganography]
**Question:** The ocean's beauty is in its clear waters, but its strength lies in its dark depths.

**Flag:** `KCTF{mul71_l4y3r3d_57360_ec4dacb5}`

We are given an image and WAV audio file to investigate. Analyzing the metadata of the image file, an encoded message can be found. It is probably a hint to find the flag, so I did some research and came across a 
[blog](https://medium.com/@ibnshehu/deepsound-audio-steganography-tool-f7ca0a897576) on audio steganography with DeepSound, kinda sus since it closely reassembles the challenge and the hint given.

![deep1](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/deep1.png)

Using the password obtained from the metadata, we can extract a a flag file from it.

![deep3](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/deep3.png)

## Flag Hunt! [Steganography]
**Question:** Hunt your way through the challenge and Capture The hidden Flag!!!

**Flag:** `KCTF{3mb3d_53cr37_4nd_z1pp17_4ll_up_ba6df32ce}`

We are given a ZIP file to investigate. The ZIP file was password protected, so I just brute-forced it with John the Ripper.

```
zip2john chall.zip > hash
john --wordlist=$rockyou hash
```

![zip1](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/zip1.png)

After extracting the ZIP file, several different files files can be identified, with `img725.jpg` being the odd one out.

![zip2](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/zip2.png)

![zip3](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/zip3.png)

Listening to the audio file within the ZIP file, a Morse code can be heard which shows a secret phrase. However, the secret phrase was not the flag.

![zip4](/assets/posts/knightctf2024/zip4.png)

Instead, it was a password for steghide on the outlier image file to obtain the real flag.
