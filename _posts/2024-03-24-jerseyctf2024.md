This is a writeup for most forensics challenges from JerseyCTF 2024. I joined this CTF when it was about to end in like 8 hours, managed to solve almost all the forensics challenges.

## substitute-detail-torrent [Forensics]
Question: We've been given a file and need to figure out what url it was downloaded from.

> Hint: Maybe its saved in file metadata somehow?

Flag: `jctf{https://www.NTFS/File/Metadata}`

We are given a wim file to investigate. Just strings the file. 

```
└─$ strings Blob.wim            
MSWIM
This is a testHostUrl:jctf{https://www.NTFS/File/Metadata}
O%{V
O%{V
```

## groovy [Forensics]
Question: You know you're getting old when you hear the music these kids are putting out and all you think is "no thank you." Anyway, I'm too old for this or maybe I need some cybernetic ears or something. Maybe you'll like these groovy tunes.

> Hint: That's not screeching weasel

Flag: `jctf{wav1ng_fr0m_th3_futur3}`

We are given a wav file to investigate. Just check the audio spectrogram.

![audio1](/assets/posts/jerseyctf2024/audio1.png)

## open-notes [Forensics]
Question: A workstatiobn we are examining had some open files at the time of the memory capture. Examine the memory image at open-notes.vmem to find the flag.

> Hint: Look around in the notepad.

Flag: `jctf{m3m0ry_f0r3ns1cs_ftw}`

Since the name and hint mentioned about notes/notepad, I dumped the `notepad.exe` process and the flag can be found.

```
└─$ python3 vol.py -f ~/Desktop/sharedfolder/jerseyctf/open-notes/open-notes.vmem -o ~/Desktop/bin  windows.memmap --dump --pid 6168

└─$ strings -e l pid.6168.dmp | grep jctf{ 
jctf{m3m0ry_f0r3ns1cs_ftw}
jctf{m
jctf{m3m0ry_f0r3ns1cs_ftw
jctf{m3m0ry_f0r3ns1cs
jctf{m3m0ry_f0r3ns1cs_ftw}
```

Another interesting method from @0x157 was that most processes can be actually loaded into GIMP as `.data` to read its content. This [blog](https://w00tsec.blogspot.com/2015/02/extracting-raw-pictures-from-memory.html) and this [blog](https://www.rootusers.com/google-ctf-2016-forensic-for1-write-up/) talks about his method and it is very interesting.

## All-Along-the-Watchtower [Forensics]
Question: Our informant has met back with us at base. He has stolen a file from a suspect who’s starting to show dangerous signs of cyberpsychosis. Aside from his unending lust for bloodshed, our informant noted that the suspect would not shut up about “rats making him crazy” as well as the term “Base FFFF+1” but that’s probably just nonsense. Anyways, can you look beyond the layers of this corrupted file to extract the information that we need?

> Hint: There's more to a file than meets the eye!

Flag: `jctf{1-4m-50-50rry-f0r-7h15}`

We are given a corrupted jpg file. Using binwalk, it was shown that it was actually a zip file with two files within it.

```
└─$ binwalk -e the-panglao-watchtower.jpg

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
130313        0x1FD09         Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: 1464, uncompressed size: 5958, name: SECRETS/password.txt
131827        0x202F3         Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: 834, uncompressed size: 834, name: SECRETS/protected_2.7z
132847        0x206EF         End of Zip archive, footer length: 22
```

Extracting the files, we obtained a `password.txt` file and another zip file to crack.

```
└─$ tree *                                                                                                          
1FD09.zip  [error opening dir]
SECRETS
├── password.txt
└── protected_2.7z

1 directory, 3 files
```

So it was obvious that a dictionary attack was required. Using `7z2john` and `john`, the zip file hash can be obtained for further cracking. The password was `jimihendrix123!`.

```
└─$ 7z2john protected_2.7z > hash

└─$ john --wordlist=password.txt hash
└─$ john --show hash

```

Cracking the zip file, we are given another text file with weird text. Researching online, I stumbled upon this [blog](https://aashutoshlodhi.medium.com/base-ffff-1-decoding-beyond-base64-f9f65d6400c2) that mentioned the decoding technique was [Base65536](https://www.better-converter.com/Encoders-Decoders/Base65536-Decode). Decoding it gives us the flag.

## living-on-the-edge [Forensics]
Question: A workstation we are examing had a browser open at the time of the acquisition. Examine the memory image living-on-the-edge.vmem to find the flag.

> Hint: Limit your search to artifacts created by Microsoft Edge

Flag: `jctf{3dg3_0f_y0ur_s3at}`

Since the name and hint mentioned about Microsoft Edge, I dumped the `msedge.exe` process and the flag can be found.

```
└─$ python3 vol.py -f ~/Desktop/sharedfolder/jerseyctf/living-on-the-edge/living-on-the-edge.vmem -o ~/Desktop/bin windows.memmap --dump --pid 5344

## rescue-mission [Forensics]
Question: Linux really lets you do anything... when messing around with my new install, I managed to delete my bootloader! Now I can't get in when I had an important file on my desktop... at least I virtualized it, maybe you can get the data out of it?

> Hint: The rescue console doesn't seem to let you read the files... seems like you need to use some other method. Perhaps you can find some tool that reads the data without launching the system? Maybe even one you've already used?

Flag: `jctf{50m3t1m35_y0u_d0nt_3v3n_n33d_t0_g3t_y0ur_hands_grubby}`

We are given a VDI file to investigate. Reading the question, it seems that the flag is probably located in the user's Desktop. Using FTK Imager, I found the flag image but it was broken/corrupted. Spending 2 hours on how I can recover its content using the slack space, I gave up and tried using `7zip` to analyze it for fun. Unexpectedly, it worked..

![ftk2](/assets/posts/jerseyctf2024/ftk2.png)

## locked-out [Forensics]
Question: I made this zip folder a while ago and I can't remember the password! I know I made it a very secure password, so wordlists won't help... can you open this folder without the password?

> Hint: The zipcrypto format used in this zip is pretty old... perhaps there's some known exploits for it? If you don't know about it, you really should know! It's always good to expand your knowledge so that you know more!

Flag: `jctf{wh0_n33d5_p455w0rd5_4nyw4y5?}`

We are given a password-protected zip file that has a text file of the flag and a SVG file. Remembering a CTF I've played previously, this relates to the [plaintext attack](https://github.com/kimci86/bkcrack) since the content within the zip was compressed using the `Store` method. Reading the description, I was right, however, there is a twist. See, most blogs will mention SVG headers to have `<?xml version="1.0"`. However, according to [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Getting_Started), SVG headers can also have this `<svg version="1.1"` as the header too.

```
└─$ unzip -Z -l locked-out.zip
Archive:  locked-out.zip
Zip file size: 173982 bytes, number of entries: 2
-rw-a--     6.3 fat    10528 Bx    10540 stor 24-Feb-19 18:19 flag.png

2 files, 173666 bytes uncompressed, 173666 bytes compressed:  0.0%
```

So the plaintext we were required to use was actually `<svg version="1.1"`, not the usual `<?xml version="1.0"`. I asked the author on this and he agreed it's true, he wanted players to actually understand the attack rather than copy pasting codes from README.md (LMAO).

```
└─$ echo -n '<svg version="1.1"' > out

Cracking the new zip file, we can get the flag.

## digital-footprint [Forensics]
Question: One of our agents in the SOC captured some traffic from a suspicious connection on the network. We need you to take a look at the pcap file and see if you can find anything useful. Call it a hunch, but we think the suspect was exchanging information somewhere, but we're not sure where, or what, or even how.

> Hint: There's more than meets the eye. If you think you found it and it didn't work... you didn't find it.

Flag: `jctf{st0mping_4r0und_1n_th3_mud_4nd_l3aving_tr4c3s}`

We are given a pcap file to investigate. There were many packets recorded in the pcap, the one that stands out the most was HTTP since there were several images transmitted within it.

![dig1](/assets/posts/jerseyctf2024/dig1.png)

Unfortunately, I could not solve this before the CTF ended. However, I read some writeups on it and it was actually pretty simple. Notice how this particular packet has a long encoded string within it.

![dig2](/assets/posts/jerseyctf2024/dig2.png)

Decoding the string gives us a png image with several colors. This is a similar concept to other CTFs I've played where color hex codes matter. So just check each hex code and the flag can be obtained.

![dig4](/assets/posts/jerseyctf2024/dig4.png)

## secret-tunnels [Forensics]
Question: An attacker has accessed the corporate network and is exfiltrating the flag!

Flag: `jctf{dn57unn3l1n6}`

We are given a pcap file to investigate. Several protocols can be found within it like HTTP, DNS and TLS. Spending an hour on this, I noticed the subdomain names were suspicious.

![wire1](/assets/posts/jerseyctf2024/wire1.png)

Extracting all the subdomains, we get a zip file (specifically PKZIP).

```
UEsDBAoACQAAAFaJLljDVaAyHwAAABMAAAAIABwAZmxhZy50eHRVVAkAA5MVpGWTFaRldXgLAAEE6AMAAATpAwAA6UotlSbkapyQ0X8p6USOjBk9sQLTAidp6liM9W56slBLBwjDVaAyHwAAABMAAABQSwECHgMKAAkAAABWiS5Yw1WgMh8AAAATAAAACAAYAAAAAAABAAAApIEAAAAAZmxhZy50eHRVVAUAA5MVpGV1eAsAAQToAwAABOkDAABQSwUGAAAAAAEAAQBOAAAAcQAAAAAA
```

![wire2](/assets/posts/jerseyctf2024/wire2.png)

However, the zip file was password protected, so we just have to crack it using `john` again. The password was `njit1220`.

```
└─$ zip2john download.zip > hash

$pkzip$1*2*2*0*1f*13*32a055c3*0*42*0*1f*8956*e94a2d9526e46a9c90d17f29e9448e8c193db102d3022769ea588cf56e7ab2*$/pkzip$

└─$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash
└─$ john --show hash 
download.zip/flag.txt:njit1220:flag.txt:download.zip::download.zip
```

Inside the zip file was a text file with the flag.

```
└─$ cat flag.txt     
jctf{dn57unn3l1n6}
```

## sticky-situation [Forensics]
Question: Somebody found this laptop running in the basement of Cullimore - right by the mailroom. Normally we'd just turn it in, but with all of the cyberattacks and cyberpsychosis going on - we're not about to throw away evidence without examining it first. Examine this ad1, and see if anything sticks out to you. I find it useful to write down my thoughts and findings on whatever I have nearby - paper, sticky notes, etc. Once I have evidence, I put it on a wall or lay it on the table and start connecting the dots. Yes, I'm crazy with strings all over the wall - but it helps! Maybe you'll find my approach useful, too?

Flag: `jctf{1_l0ve_st1cky_n0t3s_bc_th3y_h3lp_my_m3m0ry!}`

We are given an AD1 file to investigate. Using FTK Imager, I checked the common folders like Downloads, Documents, Temp and Desktop but only found unrelated files.

![notes](/assets/posts/jerseyctf2024/notes.png)

Reading the question, it seems that it is related to text files or sticky notes. Reading on Window sticky notes, I stumbled upon this [blog](https://forensafe.com/blogs/stickynotes.html) that talks about sticky note artifact located in `C:\Users\%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalStat\plum.sqlite`. The flag can be found within the artifact.

![notes1](/assets/posts/jerseyctf2024/notes1.png)

## vibrations [Forensics]
Question: While managing some of our thermal systems, we noticed unusual behavior. We collected the network traffic, see if you can find anything unusual.

Flag: `jctf{I_rEllAy_H0p3_thi$_i$nt_a_p0ol_sy$t3m_aGa1n}`

We are given a pcap file to investigate. Inside the pcap, several Modbus packets can be found being transmitted. Checking the TCP stream, the flag can actually be seen broken into several pieces on TCP stream 1.

![vibrate1](/assets/posts/jerseyctf2024/vibrate1.png)

Unfortunately, I could not solve this before the CTF ended. However, I found out that in between the flag parts were blank spaces. These blank spaces were actually letters from the bottom of the TCP stream. So just place the other letters according to the number. PS: they spelt `really` wrong.

![vibrate2](/assets/posts/jerseyctf2024/vibrate2.png)

## insecure-creds [Forensics]
Question: Sometimes forensics analysts need to use similar techniques as attackers to complete their investigation.

Flag: `jctf{keepmeinyourmemory}`

We are given a DMP file, specifically a Mini DuMP crash report to investigate. Despite being a hard challenge, I found the flag pretty quickly. Reading the question, it mentions something about credentials. So I read online on cracking DMP files to obtain credentials and stumbled upon this [blog](https://05t3.github.io/posts/DCTF/) and this [blog](https://www.whiteoaksecurity.com/blog/attacks-defenses-dumping-lsass-no-mimikatz/). Basically, we can use a tool called `PyPyKatz` or `mimikatz` to dump credentials.

```
└─$ pypykatz lsa minidump insecure-creds.DMP
