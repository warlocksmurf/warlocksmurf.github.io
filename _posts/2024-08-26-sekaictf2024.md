This is a writeup for a blockchain challenge from SekaiCTF 2024. I created this writeup to commemorate team M53's second IRL CTF session and also my first time doing blockchain CTF challenges. With the help from @Trailbl4z3r, we managed to solve a blockchain challenge together.

## Play to Earn [Blockchain]
Question: You can buy coins. Of course, you can exchange it back to cash at the original purchase price if there is any left after playing :)

Flag: `CSCTF{y0u_un-qu4rant1n3d_my_scr1Pt!_0x91a3edff6}`

## Contracts
We were given 3 contracts for this challenge: 
1. Setup.sol
   
```
pragma solidity 0.8.25;

import {Coin} from "./Coin.sol";
import {ArcadeMachine} from "./ArcadeMachine.sol";

contract Setup {
    Coin public coin;
    ArcadeMachine public arcadeMachine;

    address player;

    constructor() payable {
        coin = new Coin();
        arcadeMachine = new ArcadeMachine(coin);

        // Assume that many people have played before you ;)
        require(msg.value == 20 ether);
        coin.deposit{value: 20 ether}();
        coin.approve(address(arcadeMachine), 19 ether);
        arcadeMachine.play(19);
    }

    function register() external {
        require(player == address(0));
        player = msg.sender;
        coin.transfer(msg.sender, 1337); // free coins for new players :)
    }

    function isSolved() external view returns (bool) {
        return player != address(0) && player.balance >= 13.37 ether;
    }
}
```

The Setup.sol contract is responsible for initializing the game environment in the Play to Earn challenge. It deploys the Coin and ArcadeMachine contracts and sets up the game's essential components.
- constructor() is where state variables of a contract are initialized, in this case, the contract deposits 20 ether worth of Coin tokens and allows the ArcadeMachine to burn 19 ether.
- register() is where players register themselves to receive 1337 free coins.
- isSolved() is where the solve condition must be met (player balance must be at least 13.37 ether).

2. ArcadeMachine.sol

```
pragma solidity 0.8.25;

import {Coin} from "./Coin.sol";

contract ArcadeMachine {
    Coin coin;

    constructor(Coin _coin) {
        coin = _coin;
    }

    function play(uint256 times) external {
        // burn the coins
        require(coin.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(0), 1 ether * times));
        // Have fun XD
    }
}
```

The ArcadeMachine contract allows players to burn any amount of coins.
- play() is where the player can burn a specified amount of coins from the player's address to address(0), hence permanently removing the tokens from circulation. This also means that address(0) most likely has a huge amounts of ether stored in the blockchain.

3. Coin.sol

```
pragma solidity 0.8.25;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol";

contract Coin is Ownable, EIP712 {
    string public constant name = "COIN";
    string public constant symbol = "COIN";
    uint8 public constant decimals = 18;
    bytes32 constant PERMIT_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256("Permit(address owner,address spender,uint256 value,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)");

    event Approval(address indexed src, address indexed guy, uint256 wad);
    event Transfer(address indexed src, address indexed dst, uint256 wad);
    event Deposit(address indexed dst, uint256 wad);
    event Withdrawal(address indexed src, uint256 wad);
    event PrivilegedWithdrawal(address indexed src, uint256 wad);

    mapping(address => uint256) public nonces;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;

    constructor() Ownable(msg.sender) EIP712(name, "1") {}

    fallback() external payable {
        deposit();
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 wad) external {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
    }

    function privilegedWithdraw() external onlyOwner {
        uint256 wad = balanceOf[address(0)];
        balanceOf[address(0)] = 0;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
        emit PrivilegedWithdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
    }

    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }

    function approve(address guy, uint256 wad) public returns (bool) {
        allowance[msg.sender][guy] = wad;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, guy, wad);
        return true;
    }

    function permit(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
        external
    {
        require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "signature expired");
        bytes32 structHash = keccak256(abi.encode(PERMIT_TYPEHASH, owner, spender, value, nonces[owner]++, deadline));
        bytes32 h = _hashTypedDataV4(structHash);
        address signer = ecrecover(h, v, r, s);
        require(signer == owner, "invalid signer");
        allowance[owner][spender] = value;
        emit Approval(owner, spender, value);
    }

    function transfer(address dst, uint256 wad) public returns (bool) {
        return transferFrom(msg.sender, dst, wad);
    }

    function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint256 wad) public returns (bool) {
        require(balanceOf[src] >= wad);

        if (src != msg.sender && allowance[src][msg.sender] != type(uint256).max) {
            require(allowance[src][msg.sender] >= wad);
            allowance[src][msg.sender] -= wad;
        }

        balanceOf[src] -= wad;
        balanceOf[dst] += wad;

        emit Transfer(src, dst, wad);

        return true;
    }
}
```

The Coin.sol contract contains the vulnerability to solve the challenge.
- deposit() and withdraw() is where players can deposit and withdraw ether.
- permit() is where the contract allows off-chain approvals using signatures, in this case the signature signer must be equal to owner, allowing a third party to spend tokens on behalf of the token owner without needing on-chain approval.
- transfer() is where the movement of funds between accounts are facilitated, either by the owner directly or via an approved spender using transferFrom().
- transferFrom() is where a third party is enabled to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner, provided they have been granted an allowance through the approve or permit functions.
- privilegedWithdraw() allows the contract owner to reclaim ether sent to address(0), basically burning tokens.

### Exploit
Analyzing the contracts, it seems that the strategy to exploit the challenge was to take advantage of several vulnerabilities in the Coin contract, specifically how the permit() and transferFrom() handle permissions. Essentially, a common exploitable function can be identified on permit(), known as `ecrecover`. In Ethereum, the ecrecover function is used to verify signatures. It is a pre-compiled contract that performs public key recovery for elliptic curve cryptography. This means it can recover a public key (address) from a given signature. [Ref](https://github.com/obheda12/Solidity-Security-Compendium/blob/main/days/day12.md)

```
    function permit(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
        external
    {
        require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "signature expired");
        bytes32 structHash = keccak256(abi.encode(PERMIT_TYPEHASH, owner, spender, value, nonces[owner]++, deadline));
        bytes32 h = _hashTypedDataV4(structHash);
        address signer = ecrecover(h, v, r, s);
        require(signer == owner, "invalid signer");
        allowance[owner][spender] = value;
        emit Approval(owner, spender, value);
    }
```

Hence, a manipulated signature can be forged by setting the h, v, r and s values to 0. When these values are zero, the ecrecover function will return address(0), effectively making the signer's address equal to address(0). Because there is no zero-address check on results of the ecrecover function, any invalid signatures can be used to grant unauthorized permission. By converting the player address to address(0), the player essentially becomes the owner of address(0), thus having access the the ether stored in it.

### Solve
First thing was to obviously launch the blockchain challenge.

After setting up the environment, we must call the registry function to create a setup address (`0xfd9c64441ba433ee204ac0da0bdfe85f58c32cbe`).

As mentioned previously, the exploit can be performed by setting each value in the ecrecover function to 0s. Doing so grants the attacker a manipulated signature.

```

Being the owner of address(0), the attacker is able to transfer all the ether from it to their own address. Following this, the attacker calls the withdraw function to extract the ether into their own wallet.
