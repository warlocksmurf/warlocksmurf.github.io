This is a writeup for most challenges from rENTAS CTF 2024 (Finals). After the qualifying round, me and my team continued forward to compete in the final round with 30 teams from different universities. In the end, we only managed to achieve 20th place out of 30 teams. However, it was still an enjoyable experience as I get to meet so many new friends from M53 and SherpaSec.

## Hidden zombie [Forensics]
Flag: `RWSC{z0mb13_4tt4ck_1nc0m1ng}`

We are given a png image file of a zombie. Unfortunately, I could not solve this during the CTF. But looking back at the challenge, it was actually pretty simple (and it's definitely not DFIR ffs). The first thing I always do is to use `pngcheck` to check for any errors in the png image. It mentions that there are errors on the `IHDR` chunk so I went to fix it.

```
└─$ pngcheck -v zomba.png
zlib warning:  different version (expected 1.2.13, using 1.3)

File: zomba.png (1536669 bytes)
  chunk IHDR at offset 0x0000c, length 13
    1024 x 921 image, 32-bit RGB+alpha, non-interlaced
  CRC error in chunk IHDR (computed 80d35286, expected 7f1d2b83)
ERRORS DETECTED in zomba.png
```

After fixing the IHDR chunk.

```

Checking the png image again with `PCRT` this time, it seems that there are several IDAT chunks having incorrect lengths. So I tried adjusting the height and width of the image to find hidden secrets below or above the picture.

```
└─$ python2 PCRT.py -i ~/Desktop/sharedfolder/zomba-modified.png -o ../output.png 

         ____   ____ ____ _____

After awhile, it seems that the height was the culprit.

Additionally, a great tool recommended by another rENTAS member told me about [FotoForensics](https://fotoforensics.com/), that explains how they got first blood so quickly.

## I Hope You Have The Software [Networking]
Flag: `RWSC{!t5_a_t4c3r_f!l3_:D}`

We are given a packet tracer file to analyze a network. After looking at the connections, it seems that there were extra servers overlapping one another.

![pk1](/assets/posts/rentasctf2024final/pk1.png)

Looking at every server configurations, only server 6 had an `index.html` website in it. Checking its contents, the flag can be found.

![pk2](/assets/posts/rentasctf2024final/pk2.png)

## Anti-Brute [Web]
Flag: `RWSC{n0_brut3f0rc3_pl34s3}`

We are given a password text file. So just brute force password of admin with list given, password is `secretpass`.

## Water Sensor [Hardware]
Flag: `RWSC{ILUVU1337}`

```
ZX Company has released their brand new water sensing Arduino-based device. This innovative system is designed to detect the presence or absence of water using various sensors connected to an Arduino microcontroller board. The device typically includes one or more types of water sensors, such as resistive or capacitive sensors, which are capable of detecting changes in conductivity or capacitance when in contact with water. This advanced technology allows for accurate and reliable water detection, making it suitable for various applications ranging from flood detection to irrigation system management.

The Arduino board serves as the central processing unit, receiving input from the water sensors and executing programmed logic to interpret the sensor data and trigger appropriate actions or alerts. This can include activating pumps to remove water, sounding alarms to warn of flooding, or sending notifications to a connected device or network. This water sensor device consists of a memory size of 700MB. Every 1 minutes, it will respectively load a new set of data without clearing the old one. This allows for continuous monitoring and storage of water sensor readings over time. The device may also incorporate additional components such as relays, actuators, and communication modules (e.g., Wi-Fi, GSM) to enable more advanced functionality or remote monitoring capabilities.

Overall, this water sensing Arduino device provides a cost-effective and customizable solution for monitoring and managing water levels in various applications, including flood detection, irrigation systems, and leak detection in buildings.

Can you hack the device physically and look for any bugs according to info given?
```

Reading the question, it seems that we have to perform buffer overflow on the sensor since the memory can only hold 700 MB and it loads a new set of data every minute without clearing the old one. So we placed the water sensor for 7 minutes so that the memory will keep loading until it crashes. After it crashes, the flag can be obtained.
