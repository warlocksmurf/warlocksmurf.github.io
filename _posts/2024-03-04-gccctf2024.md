This is a writeup for all forensics challenges from GCC CTF 2024. During this CTF, I collaborated with @Odin to solve every forensics challenges. However, I was busy with another CTF during that time so I have to give credits to him for doing most of the work solving the challenges.

@Odin also left a wholesome message:
> I'm very happy when I solved all forensic challenges. We tried hard so much and this is the perfect result for us!. Thank you very much for reading our solution!

## BipBipBiiip [Forensics]
Question: Introduction to anomaly detection. Find the phone numbers that are not formed in the correct way and decode the hidden message.

Flag: `GCC{R3g3x_4r3_W1ld!!!!}`

We are given a csv file of a phonebook where the question mentioned having anomalies in it. Looking at the entries, the phone numbers were suspicious as they were weirdly placed like hex or some sorts. So regex knowledge was required in this challenge (which me and teammate suck at).

```

```

Our unintended method was pretty funny, what we did was guessing the flag by changing the starting parts of the flag `GCC{` to hex, and using the hex to find each number. The first step was to extract phone numbers only from the csv file.

```
import csv
with open(./phonebook.csv', mode='r', encoding="utf8") as file:
    csvFile = csv.reader(file)
    for lines in csvFile:
        with open("output.txt", "a") as file_written:
            file_written.write(lines[4])
            file_written.write("\n")
```

Now we have to perform our filtering to find anomalies and we found this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13719367/what-is-the-best-regular-expression-for-phone-numbers) that talks about the regex for phone numbers. Creating another simple script to filter out patterns that do not correlate to phone numbers.

```
import re

def validNumber(phone_number):
    pattern = re.compile("^[\dA-Z]{3}-[\dA-Z]{3}-[\dA-Z]{4}$", re.IGNORECASE)
    return pattern.match(phone_number) is not None
with open("output.txt", "r") as file:
    for i in file.read().split("\n"):
        if validNumber(i) == False:
            with open("not_correct.txt", "a") as file_written:
                file_written.write(i)
                file_written.write("\n")
```

After that we perform our guessing game LOL. Since we know the parts of the flag is always `GCC` and a `{}`, we can use their hex values to find the phone number that has them. Similarly, we expect `_` to be in the flag so we also include its hex.

## Pretty Links [Forensics]
Question: Following the compromise of a partner, your colleague has to capture the file system of a victim machine. In addition to that, a strange file attracted attention during its investigation.

* Find the binary used to initiate the indirect command execution
* Find the IP and port of the attacker

Format: GCC{cmd.exe:127.0.0.1:8080}

Flag: `GCC{conhost.exe:172.29.107.95:7894}`

We are given an AD1 image and an ISO file. Analyzing the ISO file, there seems to be an lnk file. In it, there is a powershell command that shows `conhost.exe` running the malware.

```
"C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe" --headless "%WINDIR%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" "$zweeki=$env:Temp;$ocounselk=[System.IO.Path]::GetFullPath($zweeki);$poledemy = $pwd;Copy-Item "$poledemy\*" -Destination $ocounselk -Recurse -Force | Out-Null;cd $ocounselk;;.\Facture.pdf; .\NisSrv.exe"
```

![link1](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/link1.png)

Next, we analyzed the AD1 image to find the malware, specifically `Facture.pdf` and `NisSrv.exe`. Since I had many cases about hackers saving their malicious files in a Temp folder, we navigated to `C:\Users\user\AppData\Temp\` . Inside the folder, the two suspicious files can be found with other temporary files.

![link2](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/link2.png)

After extracting and running `NisSrv.exe` on our virtual machine, it said that it requires `mpclient.dll` to run. Since the ``mpclient.dll`` was in the Temp folder already, we can extract it and upload it to VirusTotal. Surprisingly, it was very malicious.

![link3](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/link3.png)

![link4](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/link4.png)

Looking at the dll behavior information, the IP and port can be obtained.

## Fill the library [Forensics]
Question: An employee has been compromised following a malicious email campaign. In order to allow him to resume his activities, we have entrusted you with analyzing the email.

* Find the 3 CVEs that the attacker is trying to exploit
* Find the name of the object containing the malicious payload
* Find the family name of this malware

Format: GCC{CVE-ID_CVE-ID_CVE-ID:object_name:malware_family}

Flag: `GCC{CVE-2017-11882_CVE-2018-0798_CVE-2018-0802:EQuAtIon.3:Formbook}`

Edit: @Crazyman just did a in-depth research on why the question flag is actually wrong. I highly recommend to read his [blog](https://hackmd.io/@A3jD_2-KSHGKXuvq1LDRuA/BysMWt4pT) for more details.

We are given an EML file which sould be a phishing email. Using Thunderbird to analyze the email, an attachment named ``Bank detail.doc`` can be obtained.

By analyzing the metadata, we can retrieve the attachment data and decode it via CyberChef. Decoding it gives us a `RTF file` that seems malicious too.

![lib2](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/lib2.png)

After downloading and uploading the file to VirusTotal, the CVEs can be obtained.

![lib3](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/lib3.png)

Next, @Odin mentioned using [rtfdump](https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite/blob/master/rtfdump.py) to extract content from the RTF file. Doing so, we can obtain the name of the object containing the malicious payload.

![lib4](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/lib4.png)

Now we have to find the malware family using threat intelligence tools like [abuse.ch](https://abuse.ch/) (Recommended by @Odin). Using [URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/) and the IP address of the C2 server, several results about `Formbook` can be found.

![lib5](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/lib5.png)

Additionally, many articles discussed about Formbook with the CVEs we found previously.

![lib6](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/lib6.png)

## Threat analysis [Forensics]
While the operator was working on his machine, he noticed strange behaviour on his workstation. With the help of his CERT, he made a copy of the hard disk for analysis. Using your knowledge of forensics and threat analysis, find out some of the characteristics of this malware.

Format: GCC{portC2:MITREATT&CK_Persistence_Technique:malware_family}

Flag: `GCC{1245:T1547:njrat}`

We are given an raw disk image for our investigation. Analyzing the image file with Autopsy, a malware can be found in `C:\Users\operator\AppData\Roaming\` called `aL4N.exe`.

![threat1](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/threat1.png)

So we extracted the malware and analyzed it via VirusTotal. The MITRE ATT&CK persistence technique can be found as `T1547`.

![threat2](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/threat2.png)

Checking the file's metadata, we find that the program was compiled using `AutoIT v3`.

![threat3](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/threat3.png)

VirusTotal also shows the program being packed by AutoIT.

![threat4](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/threat4.png)

We can utilize Exe2Aut.exe which automatically to decompile AutoIt programs for us.

Part of the decompiled program:

...
```

Within the decompiled source code, the C2 IP and port can be found. Additionally, an interesting string can be found on variable `$y`.

![threat5](/assets/posts/gccctf2024/threat5.png)

Searching `0njxq80` on Google, another source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mwsrc/njRAT/blob/master/njWorm/src.txt.au3). This shows that `njRAT` was the malware family.
