This is a writeup for some forensics challenges from IrisCTF 2025.

## deldeldel [Forensics]
**Question:** I managed to log more than just keys... perhaps it was too much data to capture?

**Flag:** `irisctf{}`

We are given a PCAP file to investigate.


## Windy Day [Forensics]
**Question:** I have really bad memory. I was analyzing something but then lost track of an important note...

**Flag:** `irisctf{}`


## Tracem 1 [Forensics]
**Question:** Here at EI Corp, ethics are our top priority! That's why our IT team was shocked when we got a knock from our ISP informing us that someone on our computer network was involved in some illegitimate activity. Who would do that? Don't they know that's illegal? Our ISP's knocking (and so is HR), and we need someone to hold accountable. Can you find out who committed this violation?

**Flag:** `irisctf{}`



## Tracem 2 [Forensics]
**Question:** Another knock from our ISP and HR looking for a John Doe... but now it's not so easy.

**Flag:** `irisctf{}`
