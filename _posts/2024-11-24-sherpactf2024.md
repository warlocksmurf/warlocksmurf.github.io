This is a writeup for some misc, AI and reverse engineering challenges from SherpaCTF 2024. Instead of coping and limiting myself to only forensics challenges, I had to reignite my rusty reverse engineering and misc skills to solve a couple challenges for the team. Huge shoutout to my teammates for staying up all night together to solve certain challenges that gave us the winning lead. We managed to persevere and achieve 1st place 🥇 and also win the most creative presentation award.

## Odd 1 Out [Misc]
Question: There's an imposter among the rest of the vroom vrooms, what is it trying to say?

Flag: `SHCTF24{800_D035N7_3X157}`

We are given a CAN bus traffic log file to investigate. Knowing the author to be a car hacking lover, I knew that this challenge was gonna be heavily related to it in some way.

Doing some research, it seems like the name of the protocol was identified to be CAN protocol and the format of the logs were structured as:
```
(<TIMESTAMP>) <INTERFACE> <CAN INSTRUCTION ID>#<CAN INSTRUCTION DATA>
```

So I generated a Python script to categorize the logs according to their respective IDs using regex for better visibility.
```python
import re

d = {}

f = open("chal_candump.log","r")
g = open("processed.log","w+")

for line in f:
    s = re.sub(r"(.+) (.+) (.+)\#(.+)", r"\1\t\3\t\4", line)
    q = s.split("\t")
    if q[1] not in d:
        d[q[1]] = [s]
    else:
        d[q[1]] += [s]

for e in d:
    for x in d[e]:
        g.write(x)
    g.write("\n\n\n")
g.close()
```

Analyzing the categorized logs, majority of the IDs seem to be normal CAN instructions according to the manual. However, I noticed that the instruction data from ID 800 had unique data that weren't registered as any CAN instruction.

Extracting and decoding the data, the flag can be obtained.

## IN MY HEADDD [Misc]
Question: https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxrLa5UkwGkGiDT3IZoZUS6jDORSAjrCiQ?si=JKvLpTN-mHsA4snO FR But seriously, something is in my head, can you find it?

Flag: `SHCTF24{uN_D05_7R35_CU47r0_IN_My_H34D_24/7}`

We are given a PCAP file to investigate. Looking through the packets, several different protocols can be identified including ICMPv6, mDNS and TCP.

![head1](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/head1.png)

Analyzing further, multiple TCP packets sent to from port 8888 to 9999 seem to be dropped. This was pretty suspicious and since the description mentioned something about headers, I analyzed each TCP packet carefully to identify unique header fields.

![head2](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/head2.png)

Spending a few minutes and my sanity, I managed to identify one unique header field between the TCP packets. It seems that each TCP request had a unique identification in them which are written in hexadecimal.

![head3](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/head3.png)

So by extracting every identification value and decoding them, the flag can be obtained.

## into the matrix [AI]
Question: The Rebel Alliance has hidden a secret message in a distance matrix, camouflaged within the chaos of coordinates. Your task is to use multidimensional scaling (MDS) to uncover the hidden flag from the matrix, revealing the encoded message. With the Force guiding you, decipher the pattern, extract the flag, and restore balance to the galaxy. Can you navigate the matrix and uncover the truth before the Sith do?

Flag: `SHCTF24{Intr0_t0_ML}`

We are given a NPY file to investigate. This was a pretty easy AI challenge since I have done this before from Hack the Box. Essentially, NPY files are basically binary files that store numpy arrays. So by using the same Python script, the flag can be obtained.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.manifold import MDS

data = np.load('matrix.npy')
mds = MDS(n_components=2, dissimilarity='precomputed', random_state=42)
X = mds.fit_transform(data)
X[:, 1] = -X[:, 1]

plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1])
plt.title("Mirrored Graph (y-axis)")
plt.show()
```

## I am speed [RE]
Question: https://youtu.be/yryIJGVOovU?si=WIRVJ-xUkb5PJ1y-&t=52 this is good song. Anyways, the flag is somewhere in the code. Its all there.

Flag: `SHCTF24{c47ch_m3_1f_y0u_c4n_3012}`

We are given a PyInstaller generated executable file to investigate. So, the first thing to do was to extract the contents of the executable file to analyze it further.
```
└─$ python pyinstxtractor.py ../iamspeed.exe 
[+] Processing ../iamspeed.exe
[+] Pyinstaller version: 2.1+
[+] Python version: 3.10
[+] Length of package: 817506 bytes

[!] Skipping pyz extraction
[+] Successfully extracted pyinstaller archive: ../iamspeed.exe

You can now use a python decompiler on the pyc files within the extracted directory
```

The PYC files can then be decompiled and analyzed using any Python decompiler, in my case I used [PyLingual](https://pylingual.io/). Analyzing the decompiled `iamspeed.pyc` file, it seems that it was trying to decrypt the hex string `5c404344470d1b1b445c5b45404145581a56401b766472604d` 1000 times using a different key for each iteration.
```python
import sys
import time

def xor_string(input_string, key):
    return ''.join((chr(ord(char) ^ ord(key[i % len(key)])) for i, char in enumerate(input_string)))

def to_hex(input_string):
    return ''.join((f'{ord(char):02x}' for char in input_string))

def from_hex(hex_string):
    return ''.join((chr(int(hex_string[i:i + 2], 16)) for i in range(0, len(hex_string), 2)))
checkmeout = '5c404344470d1b1b445c5b45404145581a56401b766472604d'
decoded_input = from_hex(checkmeout)
for i in range(1000):
    key = str(i)
    decrypted = xor_string(decoded_input, key)
    sys.stdout.write(f'\rDecrypted String: {decrypted}0')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    time.sleep(0.01)
print()
print('Did you checked properly? Its somewhere on the web..')
```

However, since there was a time sleep function, the execution of the whole program will not stop which causes the output to be hardly visible. So, create a new Python script that mimics the script but ensure it outputs every decrypted string.
```python
import sys

def xor_string(input_string, key):
    return ''.join((chr(ord(char) ^ ord(key[i % len(key)])) for i, char in enumerate(input_string)))

def to_hex(input_string):
    return ''.join((f'{ord(char):02x}' for char in input_string))

def from_hex(hex_string):
    return ''.join((chr(int(hex_string[i:i + 2], 16)) for i in range(0, len(hex_string), 2)))

checkmeout = '5c404344470d1b1b445c5b45404145581a56401b766472604d'
decoded_input = from_hex(checkmeout)

results = []
for i in range(1000):
    key = str(i)
    decrypted = xor_string(decoded_input, key)
    results.append(f'Decrypted String with key {key}: {decrypted}')

print('\n'.join(results))
print('Did you check properly? It\'s somewhere on the web...')
```

Running and analyzing the output, one of the decrypted string seem to be a URL that redirects to a text file in Google Drive. The text file seem to be another hex string.

## Rest in Peace [RE]
Question: On average, there are 170,790 deaths per day. What if you can just be like "sike, imna set my rest in peace day to another time"

Flag: `SHCTF24{n0b0dy_c4n_dr46_m3_d0wn_1337}`

We are given an executable file to investigate. Decompiling and analyzing the main function, two encoded flag parts can be easily identified.

![rip1](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/rip1.png)

![rip2](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/rip2.png)

Being the lazy ass I am, I analyzed the strings of the executable file and managed to identify a key and a function called `reversed_hex`.

![rip4](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/rip4.png)

![rip3](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/rip3.png)

At that point, it was pretty obvious how the flag was encrypted.

![rip5](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/rip5.png)

## X [RE]
Question: Its a windows world

Flag: `SHCTF24{cdc5df19b407428c78ae9ae69f7f2fac}`

We are given an executable file to investigate. Decompiling and analyzing the "DialogFunc" function, it seems to be validating the user's input in the dialog box and outputting a message based on it.

![x1](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/x1.png)

Debugging it on IDA, the function logic seems to be true so far. So the objective now is to identify the right flag to input in the dialog box.

![x2](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/x2.png)

Adding a breakpoint on the "DialogFunc" function call, the source code of this function shows that it was retrieving the user input and storing it in `String` and calls a function `sub_7FF6CCD71140()` with its return value stored in `v4`. A message is then sent to the dialog, combining the result of `v4` with 1025.

```c
INT_PTR __fastcall DialogFunc(HWND a1, int a2, unsigned __int16 a3)
{
  int v4; // eax

  switch ( a2 )
  {
    case 272:
      return 1LL;
    case 273:
      if ( a3 == 2 )
      {
        EndDialog(a1, a3);
        return 1LL;
      }
      if ( a3 == 1 )
      {
        GetDlgItemTextA(a1, 1000, String, 99);
        v4 = sub_7FF6CCD71140();
        SendMessageA(a1, v4 + 1025, 0LL, 0LL);
        return 1LL;
      }
      break;
    case 1025:
      MessageBoxA(a1, "Nope !", "Please try again", 0x10u);
      return 1LL;
    case 1026:
      MessageBoxA(a1, "Congratulations !", "Please submit the flag", 0x40u);
      return 1LL;
  }
  return 0LL;
}
```

Stepping into the function `sub_7FF6CCD71140()`, the source code of this function shows that it was:

1. Checking if the input string was at least 38 characters long.
2. Validating the first 8 characters (String[0] to String[7]) using XOR with specific hex values.
3. Validating the middle 32 characters (String[8] to String[39]) are compared against a predefined array (`aBcb4ce08a36317`) with each character incremented by 1.
4. Checks that the last character (String[40]) results in '}'.

```c
__int64 sub_7FF6CCD71140()
{
  int i; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-58h]
  unsigned __int64 v2; // [rsp+8h] [rbp-50h]
  char v3[32]; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-40h] BYREF

  memset(v3, 0, sizeof(v3));
  v2 = -1LL;
  do
    ++v2;
  while ( String[v2] );
  if ( v2 < 0x26
    || (String[0] ^ 0x6B) != 56
    || (String[1] ^ 0x75) != 61
    || (String[2] ^ 0x65) != 38
    || (String[3] ^ 0x68) != 60
    || (String[4] ^ 0x74) != 50
    || (String[5] ^ 0x69) != 91
    || (String[6] ^ 0x6F) != 91
    || (String[7] ^ 0x77) != 12
    || (String[40] ^ 0x78) != 5 )
  {
    return 0LL;
  }
  qmemcpy(v3, &String[8], sizeof(v3));
  for ( i = 0; i < 32; ++i )
  {
    if ( v3[i] - 1 != aBcb4ce08a36317[i] )
      return 0LL;
  }
  return 1LL;
}
```

Checking the array `aBcb4ce08a36317`, the full value can be identified to be ``bcb4ce08a3/6317b67`d8`d58e6e1e`b``

![x3](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/x3.png)

At this point, I was stuck and could not solve this before the CTF ended. However, attempting the challenge at home, I noticed that it was actually pretty obvious. By reverse engineering the function `sub_7FF6CCD71140()`, the flag can be obtained.

```python
def xor_decrypt(position, xor_value, result):
    return chr(result ^ xor_value)

def reconstruct_middle(aBcb4ce08a36317):
    return ''.join([chr(val + 1) for val in aBcb4ce08a36317])

def main():
    aBcb4ce08a36317 = [ord(c) for c in "bcb4ce08a3/6317b67`d8`d58e6e1e`b"]

    decrypted = [
        xor_decrypt(0, 0x6B, 56),  # String[0]
        xor_decrypt(1, 0x75, 61),  # String[1]
        xor_decrypt(2, 0x65, 38),  # String[2]
        xor_decrypt(3, 0x68, 60),  # String[3]
        xor_decrypt(4, 0x74, 50),  # String[4]
        xor_decrypt(5, 0x69, 91),  # String[5]
        xor_decrypt(6, 0x6F, 91),  # String[6]
        xor_decrypt(7, 0x77, 12),  # String[7]
    ]

    middle = reconstruct_middle(aBcb4ce08a36317)
    decrypted_40 = xor_decrypt(40, 0x78, 5)
    flag = ''.join(decrypted) + middle + decrypted_40
    print("Flag:", flag)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

## Plastik-Hitam-0.2 [RE]
Question: 

Flag: `SHCTF24{0ps_Pl@st1k_H1TAM_T3W@S}`

We are given an executable file to investigate. This time the executable file seems to be packed using UPX, a common packing tool.

![hitam1](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/hitam1.png)

However, UPX fails when trying to unpack it. This was pretty strange since DiE was able to detect the packer to be UPX already, so it should be unpackable with no issues.

![hitam3](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/hitam3.png)

Doing some research online, it seems that the author had implemented an anti-UPX measure that ensures it would not unpacked using the official tool. Based on this [blog](https://coder.lufer.cc/2024/08/basectf-高校联合新生赛-week2/), it mentioned that the UPX sections had to be fixed manually to ensure that UPX identifies the executable file to be a normally packed program.

![hitam2](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/hitam2.png)

Fixing the UPX sections, the executable file can finally be unpacked and decompiled.

![hitam4](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/hitam4.png)

Analyzing the decompiled executable file, two anti-debugger functions can be identified in the program (`IsDebuggerPresent`). There was also a long base64 string, but it was either encrypted heavily or a fake flag to throw us off.

![hitam5](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/hitam5.png)

At this point, it was already midnight and I was pretty tired. So I went ahead and debugged the executable file to hope that the flag decrypts itself. Inside the debugger, the first thing was to obviously place a breakpoint on the `IsDebuggerPresent` function to ensure it can be bypassed during debugging.

![hitam6](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/hitam6.png)

After that, keep running the program until it hits the added breakpoint. Simply change the RAX value will bypass the anti-debugger functions.

![hitam7](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/hitam7.png)

Keep stepping over until the main function of the program is reached. Here, several calls to different functions can be identified. At this point, I was stuck and could not solve this before the CTF ended. However, attempting the challenge at home, I finally realized what step I overlooked. Looking at the function calls, one of them was a memcpy call that might contain the flag.

![hitam8](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/hitam8.png)

I kid you not, the final step I missed during the CTF was literally placing a breakpoint on the call before running the program again. Doing so, the flag will appear. Note to self: pay attention to the function calls next time.

![hitam9](/assets/posts/sherpactf2024/hitam9.png)
