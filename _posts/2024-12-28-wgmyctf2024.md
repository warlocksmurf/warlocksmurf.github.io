This is a writeup for some forensics, OSINT, misc and rev challenges from Wargames.MY 2024. As promised last year, I will come back stronger for Wargames.MY CTF and the final results this year was evident. What made this CTF special this year was the organizers allowing no team limit for open division teams, so this gave us the opportunity to form our own "Avengers" squad to have fun and win the CTF together. Fortunately enough, we managed to achieve 3rd place out of 266 teams (was a close battle between the top 3 teams). Please sponsor us Hot Bird!

## I Cant Manipulate People [Forensics]
**Question:** Partial traffic packet captured from hacked machine, can you analyze the provided pcap file to extract the message from the packet perhaps by reading the packet data?

**Flag:** `WGMY{1e3b71d57e466ab71b43c2641a4b34f4}`

We are given a PCAP file to investigate. According to the name of the challenge, this was most likely a classic forensics challenge that involves ICMP packets to store the flag characters within their data byte.

![icmp](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/icmp.png)

The flag can be obtained using a simple Python script.

```python
import subprocess
import binascii

def geticmp(pcap_file):
    try:
        tshark_command = [
            "tshark",
            "-r", pcap_file,
            "-T", "fields",
            "-e", "data",
            "-Y", "icmp"
        ]
        result = subprocess.run(tshark_command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
        
        if result.returncode != 0:
            raise Exception(f"Error running tshark: {result.stderr}")

        hex_data_lines = result.stdout.strip().split("\n")
        hex_data_lines = [line for line in hex_data_lines if line]
        
        if not hex_data_lines:
            return "No ICMP payload data found."
        
        concatenated_hex = "".join(hex_data_lines)
        
        decoded_data = binascii.unhexlify(concatenated_hex).decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')
        
        return decoded_data
    
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "tshark is not installed or not found in PATH."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {e}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pcap_file_path = "traffic.pcap"
    
    result = geticmp(pcap_file_path)
    
    print("Decoded ICMP Data:")
    print(result)
```

```
└─$ python icmp.py  
Decoded ICMP Data:
WGMY{1e3b71d57e466ab71b43c2641a4b34f4}
```

## Unwanted Meow [Forensics]
**Question:** Uh.. Oh.. Help me, I just browsing funny cats memes, when I click download cute cat picture, the file that been download seems little bit wierd. I accidently run the file making my files shredded. Ughh now I hate cat meowing at me.

**Flag:** `wgmy{4a4be40c96ac6314e91d93f38043a634}`

We are given a broken JPG image to investigate. Analyzing it, there were several bogus "meow" data placed within different sections of the image. 

![cat1](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/cat1.png)

The JPG image can be fixed accordingly using a simple Python script.

```python
import re

broken = "flag.shredded"
fixed = "flag.jpg"

def removecat(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, "rb") as file:
        data = file.read()

    strings = re.findall(b"[ -~]{4,}", data)
    cleaned = [re.sub(b".?meow.?", b"", string) for string in strings]
    cleaned_data = data

    for original, cleaned in zip(strings, cleaned):
        cleaned_data = cleaned_data.replace(original, cleaned)

    with open(output_file, "wb") as file:
        file.write(cleaned_data)

    print(f"Output saved to {output_file}")

removecat(broken, fixed)
```

## Oh Man [Forensics]
**Question:** We received a PCAP file from an admin who suspects an attacker exfiltrated sensitive data. Can you analyze the PCAP file and uncover what was stolen?

**Flag:** `wgmy{fbba48bee397414246f864fe4d2925e4}`

We are given a PCAP file to investigate. Analyzing it, a stream of SMB2 encrypted packets can be identified, so we must most likely find a secret key to decrypt them. Here, we can easily locate NTLM authentication exchanges within the protocol.

![smb1](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/smb1.png)

Encountering this kind of challenge before in another CTF, the method seems to be similar where we had to craft our own NTLM hash using specific information in the authentication packets. Here is a good reference about it: [How to extract NTLM Hashes from Wireshark Captures for cracking with Hashcat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhhlgoMjM7o)

![smb2](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/smb2.png)

Following the video, the final NTLM hash can be obtained using the relevant information:
```
Administrator::DESKTOP-PMNU0JK:7aaff6ea26301fc3:ae62a57caaa5dd94b68def8fb1c192f3:01010000000000008675779b2e57db01376f686e57504d770000000002001e004400450053004b0054004f0050002d0050004d004e00550030004a004b0001001e004400450053004b0054004f0050002d0050004d004e00550030004a004b0004001e004400450053004b0054004f0050002d0050004d004e00550030004a004b0003001e004400450053004b0054004f0050002d0050004d004e00550030004a004b00070008008675779b2e57db010900280063006900660073002f004400450053004b0054004f0050002d0050004d004e00550030004a004b000000000000000000
```

![smb3](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/smb3.png)

After cracking the hash, the password can be used to decrypt the SMB2 packets in Wireshark. Here, we can identify multiple decrypted SMB objects in the traffic.

![smb4](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/smb4.png)

![smb5](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/smb5.png)

The `5cRxHmEj` file seems to be showing a series of commands to dump the LSASS credentials.

```
└─$ cat %5cWindows%5cTemp%5cRxHmEj
The minidump has an invalid signature, restore it running:
scripts/restore_signature 20241225_1939.log
Done, to get the secretz run:
python3 -m pypykatz lsa minidump 20241225_1939.log
```

Essentially, we can just follow the commands accordingly using nanodump and pypykatz to obtain the flag from the log file.

## Tricky Malware [Forensics]
**Question:** My SOC detected there are Ransomware that decrypt file for fun. The script kiddies is so tricky. Here some evidence that we successfully retrieve.

**Flag:** `WGMY{8b9777c8d7da5b10b65165489302af32}`

We are given a memory dump and PCAP file to investigate. Analyzing the processes within the memory dump, several suspicious processes from `crypt.exe` can be identified being executed in a Desktop folder.

```

However, it seems that there were 3 instances of `crypt.exe` executed in the system. Dumping the first `crypt.exe` file, it was identified to be a PyInstaller executable file.

## 迅帝 [OSINT]
Question: I created this chal just because people keep asking for OSINT chal in WGMY 2023. Here we go: "18 years, I waited 18 years and finally they are active once again. We managed to obtain some artifact from their last work, it seem a secret message is hidden deep inside. Find out what to do with these files. Oh, right, our agent has further message for you: 'Melancholy Angel holds the flag.' Good Luck, you need it."

Flag: `wgmy{bf125e1fd5095254a4bd93ffc300e256}`

We are tasked to find information about the artifacts given. Analyzing them, they seem to be binary files, which 1 of them being UCL packed.

```
└─$ file *             
BUILD.DAT: UCL compressed data
BUILD.TOC: data
```

Doing some research online, I stumbled upon this [forum page](https://www.zenhax.com/viewtopic.php@t=957.html) that mentioned both the files to be game data files, specifically from Xbox 360.

![osint1](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/osint1.png)

```

Reading more about what the files were, a user from this [forum page](https://www.zenhax.com/viewtopic.php@t=1013.html) mentioned that the UCL compressed DAT file can actually be unpacked using a tool called quickbms with `tokyo_xtreme_racer.bms` (a special script for the tool).

![osint2](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/osint2.png)

![osint3](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/osint3.png)

Unpacking the file, multiple binary data and texture files can be obtained from it. After countless hours (and a great sushi lunch with the boys), I managed to figure out a dumb way to supposedly obtain the flag.

![osint4](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/osint4.png)

Since the texture files seem to be supported by GIMP, I attempted to brute force my way to find the flag from ALL the texture files. Additionally, since the challenge description mentioned something about `Melancholy Angel`, the flag can be obtained from Melancholy Angel's logo texture file.

![osint5](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/osint5.png)

> The amount of rabbit holes me and my teammate @PLZ ENTER TEXT went through was insane. We attempted to carve data from the game data files, figure out how to convert the game data files into an ISO file and emulate the Xbox game with Xemu, and search online users called Melancholy Angel on social media. Safe to say, our sanity was dead.

## Christmas GIFt [Misc]
**Question**: Here is your christmas GIFt from santa! Just open and wait for it..

**Flag:** `wgmy{51fadeb6cc77504db336850d53623177}`

We are given a large GIF file to investigate. It was pretty straightforward, the flag can be obtained from the last frame of the GIF using tools like stegsolve.

![steg1](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/steg1.png)

## The DCM Meta [Misc]
**Question:** [25, 10, 0, 3, 17, 19, 23, 27, 4, 13, 20, 8, 24, 21, 31, 15, 7, 29, 6, 1, 9, 30, 22, 5, 28, 18, 26, 11, 2, 14, 16, 12]

**Flag:** `wgmy{51fadeb6cc77504db336850d53623177}`

We are given a DCM file to investigate. Analyzing it, the flag characters can be identified within it's raw data, however, the flag was incorrect.

![dcm1](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/dcm1.png)

Being confused on why the flag was incorrect, my teammate @pikaroot managed to identify something suspicious. The challenge description seems to be an array with the index range of 0-31 (which is length of the flag). Arranging the characters using the appropriate index, the flag can be obtained.

![dcm2](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/dcm2.png)

## Stones [Rev]
**Question:** When Thanos snapped his fingers, half of the flag was blipped. We need the Avengers to retrieve the other half. There's no flag in the movie, but there is a slash flag on the server.

**Flag:** `WGMY{1d2993fc6327746830cd374debcb98f5}`

We are given an unknown file to investigate. Analyzing the file, we can see identify it to be a PyInstaller executable file.

```

local_date = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
if current_date == local_date:
    print("We're gonna need a really big brain; bigger than his?")
first_flag = 'WGMY{1d2993'
user_date = current_date
params = {'first_flag': first_flag, 'date': user_date}
response = requests.get(server_url, params=params)
if response.status_code == 200:
    print(response.json()['flag'])
else:
    print(response.json()['error'])
```

Accessing the first website (`http://3.142.133.106:8000/`), the website API seems to be expecting the first part of the flag and the correct date within the URL parameters to output the second part of the flag.

![rev1](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/rev1.png)

![rev2](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/rev2.png)

Accessing the second website (`http://just-the-time.appspot.com/`), it seems to be only be showing the current timestamp.

![rev3](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/rev3.png)

After some time, the author gave a hint mentioning something about the `/flag` path. Accessing it will lead to a YouTube video of an Avengers clip. 

![rev4](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/rev4.png)

![rev5](/assets/posts/wgmyctf2024/rev5.png)

Testing the upload date of the YouTube video, the flag can be obtained.
