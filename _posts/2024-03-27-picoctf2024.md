This is a writeup for all forensics challenges from picoCTF 2024. Overall, a pretty solid CTF with good forensics challenges where most of them were pretty simple while some required some thinking to solve. The CTF also had a long duration of 7 days so  I managed to solve all of the forensics challenges before it ended.

## Scan Surprise [Forensics]
Question: I've gotten bored of handing out flags as text. Wouldn't it be cool if they were an image instead? You can download the challenge files here: challenge.zip Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Flag: `picoCTF{p33k_@_b00_a81f0a35}`

We are given a QR code to scan. Literally just scan it.

## Verify [Forensics]
Question: People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. I want to make sure they get the real thing! I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and a decrypt script to help you know that my flags are legitimate. You can download the challenge files here: challenge.zip

Flag: `picoCTF{trust_but_verify_00011a60}`

We are given a bash script with some data files and a checksum file of `3ad37ed6c5ab81d31e4c94ae611e0adf2e9e3e6bee55804ebc7f386283e366a4`. Reading the bash script, it seems that it checks for the valid file according to the checksum given.

```sh

        #!/bin/bash

        # Check if the user provided a file name as an argument
        if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "Expected usage: decrypt.sh <filename>"
            exit 1
        fi

        # Store the provided filename in a variable
        file_name="$1"

        # Check if the provided argument is a file and not a folder
        if [ ! -f "/home/ctf-player/drop-in/$file_name" ]; then
            echo "Error: '$file_name' is not a valid file. Look inside the 'files' folder with 'ls -R'!"
            exit 1
        fi

        # If there's an error reading the file, print an error message
        if ! openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -salt -in "/home/ctf-player/drop-in/$file_name" -k picoCTF; then
            echo "Error: Failed to decrypt '$file_name'. This flag is fake! Keep looking!"
        fi
        
```

So we just have to find the valid file among the others using the checksum given. Running bash script with the valid file's name `00011a60`, the flag can be obtained.

```
└─$ sha256sum * | grep 03b52eabed517324828b9e09cbbf8a7b0911f348f76cf989ba6d51acede6d5d8
03b52eabed517324828b9e09cbbf8a7b0911f348f76cf989ba6d51acede6d5d8  00011a60

└─$ ./decrypt.sh 00011a60
picoCTF{trust_but_verify_00011a60}
```

## Mob psycho [Forensics]
Question: Can you handle APKs? Download the android apk here.

Flag: `picoCTF{ax8mC0RU6ve_NX85l4ax8mCl_a3eb5ac2}`

We are given an apk to investigate. These apk challenge are always simple, just unzip the apk and find the flag via strings, grep, find, etc.

```
└─$ find . -name 'flag*'
./mobpsycho.apk_FILES/res/color/flag.txt

└─$ cat mobpsycho.apk_FILES/res/color/flag.txt

picoCTF{ax8mC0RU6ve_NX85l4ax8mCl_a3eb5ac2}                                                                                                                                    
```

## CanYouSee [Forensics]
Question: How about some hide and seek? Download this file here.

Flag: `picoCTF{ME74D47A_HIDD3N_a6df8db8}`

We are given a image to investigate. Using Aperi'Solve, it seems that the encoded flag was found within its metadata.

## Secret of the Polyglot [Forensics]
Question: The Network Operations Center (NOC) of your local institution picked up a suspicious file, they're getting conflicting information on what type of file it is. They've brought you in as an external expert to examine the file. Can you extract all the information from this strange file? Download the suspicious file here.

Flag: `picoCTF{f1u3n7_1n_pn9_&_pdf_7f9bccd1}`

We are given a pdf file to investigate. Inside the pdf file, the second part of the flag can be found.

![pico3](/assets/posts/picoctf2024/pico3.png)

Checking the pdf, it seems that it was actually a png image instead. Changing the file extension from pdf to png, the first part of the flag can be obtained.

```
└─$ file flag2of2-final.pdf 
flag2of2-final.pdf: PNG image data, 50 x 50, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
```

## Blast from the past [Forensics]
Question: The judge for these pictures is a real fan of antiques. Can you age this photo to the specifications? Set the timestamps on this picture to 1970:01:01 00:00:00.001+00:00 with as much precision as possible for each timestamp. In this example, +00:00 is a timezone adjustment. Any timezone is acceptable as long as the time is equivalent. As an example, this timestamp is acceptable as well: 1969:12:31 19:00:00.001-05:00. For timestamps without a timezone adjustment, put them in GMT time (+00:00). The checker program provides the timestamp needed for each. Use this picture. Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Flag: `picoCTF{71m3_7r4v311ng_p1c7ur3_72ecb15c}`

We are given an image to modify. According to the question, we are required to modify every timestamp in the image to `1970:01:01 00:00:00.001+00:00`. Using a simple exiftool command, I can modify most of the metadata entries. However, one of the entries still had issues, specifically the `Samsung: TimeStamp` entry.

```
exiftool "-AllDates=1970:01:01 00:00:00.001" "-SubSecCreateDate=1970:01:01 00:00:00.001" "-SubSecDateTimeOriginal=1970:01:01 00:00:00.001" "-SubSecModifyDate=1970:01:01 00:00:00.001" original.jpg
```

After some thinking, I tried manually editing the hex value of the image to modify that specific metadata. The timestamp is written in Epoch Time, so I have to modify `1700513181420` to `0000000000001`.

## endianness-v2 [Forensics]
Question: Here's a file that was recovered from a 32-bits system that organized the bytes a weird way. We're not even sure what type of file it is. Download it here and see what you can get out of it.

Flag: `picoCTF{cert!f1Ed_iNd!4n_s0rrY_3nDian_76e05f49}`

We are given a file to investigate. Checking its hex values, it seem that each byte was reversed just like big endian and little endian.

```

```

Researching online about converting a file from little endian to big endian, I stumbled upon this [forum](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/239543/is-there-a-oneliner-that-converts-a-binary-file-from-little-endian-to-big-endian) that has a single command to convert the bytes.

## Dear Diary [Forensics]
Question: If you can find the flag on this disk image, we can close the case for good!Download the disk image here.

Flag: `picoCTF{1_533_n4m35_80d24b30}`

We are given a disk image to investigate. Opening it on Autopsy, a suspicious text file can be found on the `root` directory. However, it seems that the text file is deleted or shredded so the data can not be retrieved.

![pico7](/assets/posts/picoctf2024/pico7.png)

Reading online about retrieving deleted and shredded files, I found this [writeup](https://dev.to/lambdamamba/ctf-writeup-picoctf-2022-forensics-55p3) that talks about a similar challenge created by picoCTF too. Just follow the steps in the writeup but instead of a single text file, we find out that the text file was broken up into pieces.

```
└─$ strings -t d disk.flag.img | grep -iE "innocuous-file.txt"          
600033336 innocuous-file.txt
728730680 innocuous-file.txt
728743992 innocuous-file.txt
728752184 innocuous-file.txt
728758328 innocuous-file.txt
728767544 innocuous-file.txt
728776760 innocuous-file.txt
728785976 innocuous-file.txt
728792120 innocuous-file.txt
728801336 innocuous-file.txt
728807480 innocuous-file.txt
728816696 innocuous-file.txt
728825912 innocuous-file.txt
728832056 innocuous-file.txt
```

So I can create a simple Python script to do the offset calculations automatically.

```python
import subprocess

inno_offsets = [600033336, 728730680, 728743992, 728752184, 728758328, 728767544, 728776760, 728785976, 728792120, 728801336, 728807480, 728816696, 728825912, 728832056]

offsets_minus = [(offset - 584056832) / 1024 for offset in inno_offsets]

results = []

print(offsets_minus)

for offset in offsets_minus:
    cmd = f"ifind -f ext4 -o 0001140736 -d {int(offset)} ./disk.flag.img"

    result = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)

    results.append(result.stdout)

print(results)
```

With the offsets, the flag parts can be obtained.

```
└─$ icat -f ext4 -o 1140736 disk.flag.img 8 | hexdump -C | grep inno -A 5 -B 5
