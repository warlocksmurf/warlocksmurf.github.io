This is a writeup for all forensics challenges from N0PSctf 2024. Initially, I did not want to create a writeup for this CTF because of time constraints. But I still did it anyways as I found the forensics challenges to be very interesting and can be referenced in the future.

## HID [Forensics]
Question: what did I write ???

Flag: `N0PS{m0Us3_dR4w1Ng}`

We are given a pcap file to investigate. Analyzing it, it was obviously a USB device that was captured in the pcap. Looking at the `GET DESCRIPTOR Response STRING`, we can see that the HID data probably belonged to a USB gaming mouse.

Scrolling further down, we can see that majority of `URB_INTERRUPT in` packets have either length 64 or 71.

So by filtering with `usb.src == "3.11.1" && frame.len == 71` and exporting the whole pcap to a JSON file, we can easily get all the HID data. However, at this point I was stuck as I was still new at USB forensics.

Reading writeups on it, there were many ways to plot the mouse movements into images. Here are some good references on plotting mouse movements:

1. [CrewCTF 2022](https://github.com/xXLeoXxOne/writeups/blob/main/CrewCTF%202022/Paint.md)
2. [7h4nd5RG0d](https://github.com/7h4nd5RG0d/Forensics/blob/main/Networking/HID(USB-Mouse%20Drawing)/code.py)

This was my method after the CTF.

```
import itertools
import json
import turtle

def main():
    # Load the packet data from the JSON file
    with open('data.json') as packets_export_file:
        packets = json.load(packets_export_file)

    # Extract the x and y offsets from the packet data
    x_offsets = [int(p["_source"]["layers"]["usbhid.data_tree"]["usbhid.data.axis.x"]) for p in packets]
    y_offsets = [-int(p["_source"]["layers"]["usbhid.data_tree"]["usbhid.data.axis.y"]) for p in packets]

    # Calculate the cumulative positions
    x_positions = list(itertools.accumulate(x_offsets))
    y_positions = list(itertools.accumulate(y_offsets))

    # Determine the range of x and y positions for setting up the screen
    min_x, max_x = min(x_positions), max(x_positions)
    min_y, max_y = min(y_positions), max(y_positions)

    # Set up the turtle screen with dynamic resolution
    screen = turtle.Screen()
    screen.title("Mouse Position Tracker")
    screen.setup(width=max_x - min_x + 100, height=max_y - min_y + 100)
    screen.screensize(canvwidth=max_x - min_x + 100, canvheight=max_y - min_y + 100)
    screen.setworldcoordinates(min_x - 50, min_y - 50, max_x + 50, max_y + 50)
    
    # Create a turtle to draw the positions
    pen = turtle.Turtle()
    pen.penup()
    pen.goto(x_positions[0], y_positions[0])
    pen.pendown()

    # Draw the mouse positions
    for x, y in zip(x_positions, y_positions):
        pen.goto(x, y)

    # Keep the window open until clicked
    screen.mainloop()

main()
```

## ZipZip [Forensics]
Question: zipzipzipzipzipzip

Flag: `N0PS{z1p_z1p_z1p_z1p}`

We are given a zip file to investigate. Inside the zip file was a file called `4ad9edde81b5526dcd95747a96a90583` which was useless. Given some hints from the author, it seems that another hidden file was embedded within the zip file. However, I could not finish this CTF on time, but a writeup from [7h4nd5RG0d](https://github.com/7h4nd5RG0d/Forensics/tree/main/Steganography/zipzip(ZIP%20file%20format)) pretty much sums it all up. Basically, we can just extract the hidden file's data after its file name and deflate it with a simple script.

```
import zlib

# Hex string of the compressed data
compressed_hex_str = "F3330808AEAE322C8847C2B500"

# Convert the hex string to bytes
compressed_bytes = bytes.fromhex(compressed_hex_str)

# Decompress the data using raw DEFLATE compression
try:
    uncompressed_bytes = zlib.decompress(compressed_bytes, -zlib.MAX_WBITS)
    print(uncompressed_bytes)
except zlib.error as e:
    print(f"Decompression error: {e}")
```

```
└─$ python deflate.py 
b'N0PS{z1p_z1p_z1p_z1p}'
```
