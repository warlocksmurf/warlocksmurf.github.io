This was my first local CTF I've participated with my friends @Shen and @Blugon during my degree studies. In the end we managed to achive 4th place out of 10 teams locally and 34th out of 60 teams regionally. Being the first CTF of my life, this was a huge confidence boost and it started my interest in DFIR and Threat Hunting.

### Challenges
Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve the files and flags but basically I cleared an OSINT challenge where I had to use WayBackMachine to check an ex-employee's name of a website and 2 Threat Hunting challenges where I had to investigat a compromised machine. One malware was located in the user's Desktop while the other was in the Preference folder.
