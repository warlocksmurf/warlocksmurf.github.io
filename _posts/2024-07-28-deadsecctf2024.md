This is a writeup for some misc and OSINT challenges from DeadSec CTF 2024. Another W for L3ak where we achieved 1st place 🥇! The misc challenge was interesting as it showcased a new method of cracking zip files using ZipCrypto method. However, the OSINT challenges were pretty lackluster and very little leads, hope the authors improve them next year.

## Forgotten Password [Misc]
Question: I was going to create this extremely easy forensics challenge for you, but accidentally used the flag as the password when I encrypted the archive. This flag is now deleted, and since it is not possible to brute-force it, I guess that means this challenge can no longer be solved, or can it?

Flag: `DEAD{weird_how_this_encryption_is_the_default_in_2024}`

We are given a zip file and a Python script to investigate. Analyzing the Python script first, it seems to create an ISO file containing the flag and packages the ISO file into a password-protected ZIP file using the flag as the password.

```
from io import BytesIO
import os
import subprocess
import pycdlib # pip install pycdlib

try:
    FLAG = open("flag.txt","r").read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    FLAG = "fake_flag_for_testing"

iso = pycdlib.PyCdlib()
iso.new(interchange_level=4)

iso.add_fp(BytesIO(FLAG.encode()), len(FLAG), '/flag.txt;1')

iso.write('challenge.iso')
iso.close()

subprocess.check_output(["zip", "challenge.zip", "challenge.iso", "-P", FLAG])
```

Analyzing the given zip file, the zip encryption method can be identified as `ZipCrypto Deflate`, a legacy zip encryption method that can be cracked using a known plaintext attack. A great tool for this type of zip files is [bkcrack](https://github.com/kimci86/bkcrack).

```
└─$ 7z l -slt challenge.zip

1 file, 574 bytes (1 KiB)

```

However, the `ZipCrypto Deflate` method essentially deflates the files before compressing them into a zip file, making the attack infeasible since the starting 12 byte plaintext will be unknown. Spending some hours on this, our teammate @Kibeth suggested that we generate our own ISO files using the given Python script and placed them into unencrypted zip files to analyze the hex bytes of the deflated ISO file.

![zip1](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/zip1.png)

Notice how both deflate streams have a long series of null bytes. This was due to the [nature](https://superuser.com/questions/450272/unable-to-open-iso-file-by-using-winrar) of ISO files where they contain loads of null bytes in them. So, instead of guessing the starting 12 byte plaintext for the attack to work, an offset can be specified to read the section that has at least 12 null bytes in the unencrypted zip file for bkcrack to obtain the appropriate keys.

```
❯ .\bkcrack.exe -C challenge.zip -c challenge.iso -x 68 0000000000000000000000000000

After obtaining the keys, the given zip file can be decrypted and the flag can be obtained.

```

## Windows Server [OSINT]
Question: From this picture, please provide me with the following information:
- IP
- ISP
- ASN

Flag: `DEAD{187.17.201.3_abcrede provedor de internet ltda_as28265}`

We are given a screenshot of the Windows Server login page to investigate. 

![server1](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/server1.png)

The screenshot shows 3 users with the second user having his full name as the username. Just lookup the username on [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=Leandro+Couto+Nunes) to get his IP address. To obtain the ISP and ASN, just lookup his IP on [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/host/187.17.201.3) too.

## Financial supporter 1 [OSINT]
Question: You have received a secret mission, which is to attack a criminal organization. There is no information about this organization; we only know the name of the financial supporter for this organization, whose name is "Calista Diamante". Your task is to find her weak points, then infiltrate and attack the company. First, let me know what phone she uses.

Flag: `dead{iphone_14_plus}`

Looking up common social media websites, `Calista Diamante` can be identified on Instagram. One of the post had a hashtag that could be useful for the search.

![fin1](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/fin1.png)

![fin2](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/fin2.png)

However, the hashtag could not give any results on X. After a few hours, the author gave us the X account saying that the challenge was broken (bruh).

![fin3](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/fin3.png)

So the username of Calista is identified as `c411sta`. Looking up the username on Sherlock, several accounts can be found.

```

One of the scrapped accounts was [Keybase](https://keybase.io/c411sta) which stored the information of her mobile device.

## Financial supporter 2 [OSINT]
Question: Very good, you have obtained information about her phone. Dig deeper and let me know what secret she is keeping.

Flag: `dead{greenland-land_0f_ice}`

Checking her [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@c411sta) account, one of her post was previously edited 3 times. The earliest edit mentioned hiding a secret in `my beautiful country`.

![fin6](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/fin6.png)

![fin7](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/fin7.png)

Checking her [DailyMotion](https://www.dailymotion.com/c411sta) account, a weird text can be found on the account status. My teammate @Aquora found out that the weird text can be used as a URI in DailyMotion to access a private video titled [My beautiful country](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/k4p2fm6A2iFmpoBa7Ce). After spending a few hours, the flag can be found in the video frames. PS: using 'E' can view the video frame-by-frame on VLC.

![fin8](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/fin8.png)

## Financial supporter 3 [OSINT]
Question: It seems they sent a stealth expert to rescue her from our pursuit. Let's try to find information about him. Let me know what his alias is???

Flag: `dead{beck}`

Continuing the search, my teammate @Aquora found a secret URL in one of the GIF posted in X.

![fin9](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/fin9.png)

The URL leads us to a [page](https://anotepad.com/notes/aee69asa) with a Discord server link. 

![fin10](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/fin10.png)

The Discord server had some information about the person.

![fin11](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/fin11.png)

![fin12](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/fin12.png)

At this point, me and my teammates was super exhausted and did not solve it in time. However, the authors gave the official writeup on it so I will credit it here. Apparently, the image of the watchtower could be reverse searched on Google (does not work consistently). One of the results will lead to this [website](https://bellis.io/app/attraktion/maastrup_mose_porsevej) that mentioned the location to be `Måstrup Mose, Porsevej`. Using the plus code given `G7HJ+5CR`, the exact location can be obtained.

![fin13](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/fin13.png)

The authors also provided hints during the CTF mentioning something about WiFi.

![fin14](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/fin14.png)

So by utilizing WiFi lookup sites like [wigle](https://wigle.net/), the alias can be identified on the SSID.

![fin15](/assets/posts/deadsecctf2024/fin15.png)
