This is a writeup for forensics, networking and OSINT challenges from IrisCTF 2024. Overall, this CTF was very enjoyable despite the challenges be super difficult (especially the forensics). However, the challenges felt realistic and so it helped train my DFIR skills further. During the CTF, I met a new friend @seal who also plays forensics challenges and make good writeups on them too.

## Not Just Media [Forensics]
Question: I downloaded a video from the internet, but I think I got the wrong subtitles. Note: The flag is all lowercase.

Flag: `irisctf{mkvm3rg3_my_b3l0v3d}`

We are given a weird mkv video file. Reading the scenario, the subtitles are probably the key to the flag. Researching online, we can use [mkvinfo](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mkvinfo) to find tracks and subtitles embedded within a mkv video.

![media1](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/media1.png)

Analyzing its metadata, we can extract the subtitles and a suspicious font file called `FakeFont.ttf`.

![media2](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/media2.png)

The subtitles seem to be chinese letters. So we just have to combine both files together using [fontdrop.io](https://fontdrop.info/#/?darkmode=true) and the flag can be obtained.

## skat's SD card [Forensics]
Question: "Do I love being manager? I love my kids. I love real estate. I love ceramics. I love chocolate. I love computers. I love trains."

Flag: `irisctf{0h_cr4p_ive_left_my_k3ys_out_4nd_ab0ut}`

We are given a Linux file system to investigate. Using Autopsy, I went ahead and analyzed the user's directory and found `.bash_history` file. Analyzing the file, it seems that the user skat downloaded a repository from GitHub called `skats-interesting-things.git`.

![skat1](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/skat1.png)

So I attempted to clone the repository myself but it required a secret key. At this point I was stuck and could not solve it before the CTF ended, but I asked several members on Discord and they told me we can actually extract the public key from the hidden files. Going through the directories again, we can actually find another hidden directory called `.ssh` that stores RSA keys.

![skat2](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/skat2.png)

We can brute force the private key using John the Ripper to obtain the passphrase.
```
ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa.hash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt id_rsa.hash
```

The cracked password was `password` (that's not very secure skat!). Before that, we have to also copy both the private key and public key to my `~/.ssh` directory to be used for authorisation. Cloning the repository, multiple text files and a hidden directory `.git` can be obtained.

![skat3](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/skat3.png)

@seal on Discord mentioned that we can use a tool called [packfile_reader](https://github.com/robisonsantos/packfile_reader) to extract and parse `.git` data to some text files. Navigating to `.git/objects/pack`, we can utilize the tool and just grep the flag.

## Where's skat? [Networking]
Question: While traveling over the holidays, I was doing some casual wardriving (as I often do). Can you use my capture to find where I went? Note: the flag is irisctf{the_location}, where the_location is the full name of my destination location, not the street address. For example, irisctf{Washington_Monument}. Note that the flag is not case sensitive.

Flag: `irisctf{los_angeles_union_station}`

We are given a pcap file to investigate skat's location. Analyzing the packets, I noticed the user's device communicating with nearby routers and it seems to lead to the same place everytime (according to the SSID).

![where1](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/where1.png)

From what I understand, it seems that skat is being in some station as it shows multiple Metro SSIDs and by checking LAUS with Morlin together (I thought Morlin was a hotel), we can get the location.

![where2](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/where2.png)

## skat's Network History [Networking]
Question: "I love cats." Note: this challenge is a continuation to Forensics/skat's SD Card. You are dealing with the same scenario. skats-sd-card.tar.gz is the same file from that challenge (SHA-1: 4cd743d125b5d27c1b284f89e299422af1c37ffc).

Flag: `irisctf{i_sp3nd_m0st_of_my_t1me_0n_th3_1nt3rnet_w4tch1ng_c4t_v1d30s}`

We are given a pcap file again and some encrypted 802.11 packets. Additionally, the question mentioned the challenge being a continuation to Forensics/skat's SD Card. Unfortunately, I could not solve this challenge before the CTF ended, but @seal taught me the method so big shoutout to him/her!!

Poking around skat's directory in the SD card from the Forensics challenge, the `Bookshelf` folder has a manual book for setting up a Raspberry Pi. Analyzing the `skatnet.nmconnection` file located in `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connection/`, a WiFi password (PSK) can be identified.

```
[connection]
id=skatnet
uuid=470a7376-d569-444c-a135-39f5e57ea095
type=wifi
interface-name=wlan0

[wifi]
mode=infrastructure
ssid=skatnet

[wifi-security]
auth-alg=open
key-mgmt=wpa-psk
psk=agdifbe7dv1iruf7ei2v5op

[ipv4]
method=auto

[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=default
method=auto

[proxy]
```

With the PSK, we can decrypt the packets using Wireshark by navigating to `Preferences > Protocols > IEEE 802.11 > Edit`.

![history1](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/history1.png)

We are also given some SSL keys in a file called `sslkeyfile`, so we can import them to Wireshark by navigating to `Protocols > TLS > (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename` which allows us decrypt certain packets in the pcap.

![history2](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/history2.png)

After decrypting, we can find several HTTP/2 packets (first time hearing about this) when analyzing the traffic. A pastebin entry can be found in the traffic and the data response for it has the flag.

## Czech Where? [OSINT]
Question: Iris visited this cool shop a while back, but forgot where it was! What street is it on?

Flag: `irisctf{zlata_ulicka_u_daliborky}`

We are given an image of a supposedly Czech location. Just perform a Google reverse search to at least identify the location's name.

![czech1](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/czech1.png)

The location's name can be found in a Japanese blog. Looking into Google Maps for Czech Golden Lane, the street name can be obtained.

## Away on Vacation [OSINT]
Question: Iris and her assistant are away on vacation. She left an audio message explaining how to get in touch with her assistant. See what you can learn about the assistant.

Flag: `irisctf{pub1ic_4cc0unt5_4r3_51tt1ng_duck5}`

We are given a voicemail of a person named Iris Stein.
```
Hello, you’ve reached Iris Stein, head of the HR department!
I’m currently away on vacation, please contact my assistant Michel.
You can reach out to him at michelangelocorning0490@gmail.com. Have a good day and take care.
```

Funny thing is I actually went to email Michel since the CTF authors told me its allowed. Doing so, I got an automatic reply from Michel stating that he is also on vacation now and I can reach out to him via social media.

![vac1](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/vac1.png)

Going through common social media platforms, Michel can be found on Instagram where the flag was in one of his posts.

## Personal Breach [OSINT]
Question: Security questions can be solved by reconnaissance. The weakest link in security could be the people around you.

Flag: `irisctf{s0c1al_m3d1a_1s_an_1nf3cti0n}`

We are tasked to look for information about a person called Iris Stein:
```
1. How old is Iris? 
2. What hospital was Iris born in?
3. What company does Iris work for?
```

Since we know Iris is associated with Michel in some way, we can find her being one Michel's followers.

![iris1](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/iris1.png)

Going through all of her posts, we find that even her mom, Elaina Stein, has a social media account. Looking everywhere for her mom, Facebook seems to be the social media platform she was using.

![iris2](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/iris2.png)

![iris3](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/iris3.png)

Going through Eleina's posts, we find a life event post on her daughter's birth date. There we can find Iris Stein's age to be `27 years old`.

![iris4](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/iris4.png)

Just Google reverse search the hospital picture and the name of the hospital can be found. The name of the specific hospital was `Lenox Hill Hospital`.

![iris5](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/iris5.png)

Finally, I went ahead to Linkedin to find her company. Since we know she is the HR department from the voicemail previously, the search will be easier. The company was `Mountain Peek Hiring Agency`.

![iris6](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/iris6.png)

Answering all the questions, the flag is given.

## A Harsh Reality of Passwords [OSINT]
Question: Recently, Iris’s company had a breach. Her password’s hash has been exposed. This challenge is focused on understanding Iris as a person. Hash: $2b$04$DkQOnBXHNLw2cnsmSEdM0uyN3NHLUb9I5IIUF3akpLwoy7dlhgyEC

Flag: `irisctf{PortofinoItalyTiramisu0481965}`

Unfortunately, I could not solve this challenge before the CTF ended, however, I did attempt it later on and found it quite interesting. Basically from what the scenario mentioned, we have to find several characters and digits to create our own password dictionary to crack the hash given. Doing some research on the hash, it was identified to be `bcrypt $2*$, Blowfish (Unix)`.

We can see that she mentioned her Mother's birthday being a very important date, so thats one of the details we can use for our dictionary.

![hash1](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/hash1.png)

She also mentioned her love for Tiramisu, that's going on the dictionary.

![hash2](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/hash2.png)

In this post she talks about an important place in Italy called Portofino.

![hash3](/assets/posts/irisctf2024/hash3.png)

A dictionary file can then be created with the important words and her mother's birthdate (the admins gave us a hint on this). I also added in Iris Stein and Elaina Stein into the word pile.
```
from itertools import permutations

words = ["Iris", "Stein", "Elaina", "Tiramisu", "Portofino", "Mimosas", "Italy"]
word_combinations = permutations(words, 3)
all_word_combinations = [''.join(combo) for combo in word_combinations]

date_numbers = "8041965"
num_combinations = permutations(date_numbers, len(date_numbers))
all_num_combinations = [''.join(combo) for combo in num_combinations]

combined_results = [word_combo + num_combo for word_combo in all_word_combinations for num_combo in all_num_combinations]

# Save the output to a text file
output_file_path = "output.txt"
with open(output_file_path, 'w') as output_file:
    for result in combined_results:
        output_file.write(result + '\n')

print(f"Output saved to {output_file_path}")
```

Using hashcat, we can crack the hash and obtain the password.
```
hashcat -m 3200 hash output.txt
```
