Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve the old files and flags, but basically I cleared an OSINT challenge where I had to use WayBackMachine to check an ex-employee's name of a website and 2 Threat Hunting challenges where I had to investigat a compromised machine. One malware was located in the user's Desktop while the other was in the Preference folder.
