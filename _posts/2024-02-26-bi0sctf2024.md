This is a writeup for all forensics challenges from bi0sCTF 2024. Unfortunately, I was busy with my internship so I could not finish the forensics challenges before the CTF ended. However, I did attempt them after the CTF to improve my DFIR skills and I managed to find all the flags!! (If only I had time to play it)

## Scenario [Forensics]
> Randon, an IT employee finds a USB on his desk after recess. Unable to contain his curiosity he decides to plug it in. Suddenly the computer goes haywire and before he knows it, some windows pops open and closes on its own. With no clue of what just happened, he tries seeking help from a colleague. Even after Richard’s effort to remove the malware, Randon noticed that the malware persisted after his system restarted.

## verboten 1 [Forensics]
Question: What is the serial number of the sandisk usb that he plugged into the system? And when did he plug it into the system? Format: verboten{serial_number:YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS}

Flag: `verboten{4C530001090312109353&0:2024-02-16-12-01-57}`

We are given an AD1 image file for our investigation, which can be analyzed using FTK Imager. I remembered learning about USB registries from other CTFs, so I did some research on what registries I should look out for and this [blog](https://www.cybrary.it/blog/usb-forensics-find-the-history-of-every-connected-usb-device-on-your-computer) mentioned that the serial ID of the USB and the timestamp of when it was plugged into the system can be located in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR`.

## verboten 2 [Forensics]
Question: What is the hash of the url from which the executable in the usb downloaded the malware from? Format: verboten{md5(url)}

Flag: `verboten{11ecc1766b893aa2835f5e185147d1d2}`

The question mentioned 'url' and 'downloaded', so the answer is most likely in the user's browser history. Going through the browsers in Randon's machine, it seems that the user has Chrome installed. So I extracted several Chrome artifacts located in `C:\Users\randon\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\` for further analysis.

![verboten2](/assets/posts/bi0sctf2024/verboten2.png)

By analyzing the `History` artifact, the URL can be identified as `https://filebin.net/qde72esvln1cor0t/mal`.

## verboten 3 [Forensics]
Question: What is the hash of the malware that the executable in the usb downloaded which persisted even after the efforts to remove the malware? Format: verboten{md5{malware_executable)}

Flag: `verboten{169cbd05b7095f4dc9530f35a6980a79}`

Since the malware was already identified in the previous question, we just have to look for it in Randon's machine. After going through several common directories, the malware was actually found in `C:\Users\randon\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Startup\`.

![verboten5](/assets/posts/bi0sctf2024/verboten5.png)

## verboten 4 [Forensics]
Question: What is the hash of the zip file and the invite address of the remote desktop that was sent through slack? Format: verboten{md5(zip_file):invite_address}

Flag: `verboten{b092eb225b07e17ba8a70b755ba97050:1541069606}`

Reading the question, it mentions Slack (a messaging app that can be installed in Windows and mobile devices). The Slack directory is located in `C:\Users\randon\AppData\Roaming\` and inside it, one file that caught my eye was `root-state.json`. Using a JSON beautifier tool, it shows the name of the downloaded zip file clearly as `file_shredder.zip`.

![verboten6](/assets/posts/bi0sctf2024/verboten6.png)

![verboten7](/assets/posts/bi0sctf2024/verboten7.png)

Reading on how I can extract cached files in Slack, I found this [blog](https://medium.com/@jeroenverhaeghe/forensics-finding-slack-chat-artifacts-d5eeffd31b9c) that mentioned using [Nirsoft Chrome Cache Viewer](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cache_view.html) to view cached data in Slack. By filtering the name of the zip file ('file_shredder'), we can find the MD5 hash of the zip in the ETag column.

![verboten8](/assets/posts/bi0sctf2024/verboten8.png)

Reading the blog again, I analyze the IndexedDB blob file in `C:\Users\randon\AppData\Roaming\Slack\IndexedDB\` to identify the invite address. Using grep, the invite address can be found with a suspicious text about AnyDesk connection. 

![verboten9](/assets/posts/bi0sctf2024/verboten9.png)

Another method from @Dysnome is to use this [tool](https://github.com/0xHasanM/Slack-Parser) to parse Slack conversations.

## verboten 5 [Forensics]
Question: What is the hash of all the files that were synced to Google Drive before it was shredded? Format: verboten{md5 of each file separated by ':'}

Flag: `verboten{ae679ca994f131ea139d42b507ecf457:4a47ee64b8d91be37a279aa370753ec9:870643eec523b3f33f6f4b4758b3d14c:c143b7a7b67d488c9f9945d98c934ac6:e6e6a0a39a4b298c2034fde4b3df302a}`

Doing some research online, I found this interesting [blog](https://amgedwageh.medium.com/drivefs-sleuth-investigating-google-drive-file-streams-disk-artifacts-0b5ea637c980) about Google Drive forensics. The blog mentions a tool called [DriveFS Sleuth](https://github.com/AmgdGocha/DriveFS-Sleuth) to parse Google Drive File Stream disk artifacts and identify deleted files.

## verboten 6 [Forensics]
Question: What is time of the incoming connection on AnyDesk? And what is the ID of user from which the connection is requested? Format: verboten{YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS:user_id}

Flag: `verboten{2024-02-16-20-29-04:221436813}`

Reading the question, it mentions AnyDesk (a program for Windows that allows you to remotely access another computer). Analyzing Randon's machine, the AnyDesk directory can be found in `C:\Users\randon\AppData\Roaming\`. Doing some research online, I found this [blog](https://medium.com/@tylerbrozek/anydesk-forensics-anydesk-log-analysis-b77ea37b90f1) that talks about AnyDesk forensics. The blog mentions that the information about successful AnyDesk connections are stored in `ad.trace` log file.

![verboten11](/assets/posts/bi0sctf2024/verboten11.png)

So by filtering with the word 'incoming', the information about the AnyDesk connection can be found.

![verboten12](/assets/posts/bi0sctf2024/verboten12.png)

## verboten 7 [Forensics]
Question: When was the shredder executed? Format: verboten{YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS}

Flag: `verboten{2024-02-16-08-31-06}`

Reading the question, it mentions a shredder being executed. I assume it refers to an executable file within `file_shredder.zip`. However, this zip file was identified previously and assumed to be deleted since it was not present in the Downloads directory. Looking at common Window artifacts, prefetch files should be the best bet to gather information on deleted executables. Using [PECmd](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/PECmd) to parse the prefetch files, they can be further analyze using Timeline Explorer. Filtering with the word 'file_shredder', the executed date of `BLANKANDSECURE_X64.EXE-DF0E2BF6.pf` can be identified in the 'SourceModified' entry. However, the date should be adjusted to 12H time format as mentioned by the authors.

## verboten 8 [Forensics]
Question: What are the answers of the backup questions for resetting the windows password? Format: verboten{answer_1:answer_2:answer_3}

Flag: `verboten{Stuart:FutureKidsSchool:Howard}`

The question mentions something about Windows password, so I assume the answer is in one of the Windows artifacts again. I randomly guessed that it was located in `SAM` hive since it stores local passwords for a Windows machine. Analyzing the hive, the answers for the backup questions can be found in the 'ResetData' entry.

![verboten14](/assets/posts/bi0sctf2024/verboten14.png)

```
Reset Data
{"version":1,"questions":[{"question":"What was your first pet’s name?","answer":"Stuart"},{"question":"What’s the name of the first school you attended?","answer":"FutureKidsSchool"},{"question":"What’s the first name of your oldest cousin?","answer":"Howard"}]}
```

## verboten 9 [Forensics]
Question: What is the single use code that he copied into the clipboard and when did he copy it? Format: verboten{single_use_code:YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS}

Flag: `verboten{830030:2024-02-16-23-24-43}`

The question mentions clipboard history, so I did some research online I found this [blog](https://www.inversecos.com/2022/05/how-to-perform-clipboard-forensics.html). Pretty straightforward, just extract and analyze the `ActivitiesCache.db` file located in `\Users\randon\AppData\Local\ConnectedDevicesPlatform\dd683d380e7fa229\`. The 'ClipboardPayload' column shows the clipboard content.

![verboten15](/assets/posts/bi0sctf2024/verboten15.png)

![verboten16](/assets/posts/bi0sctf2024/verboten16.png)

For the epoch time in 'LastModifiedOnClient' column, it should be adjusted to IST timezone format as mentioned by the authors. So we can identify the time and convert it to get the real time.

## Welcome [Misc]
Question: Some things are hidden in plain sight.

Flag: `bi0sctf{h1dd3n_1n_pl41n_s1ght}`

I know this is just a welcome flag, but I still found it cool how this flag was hidden using Discord. Just copy the text of the annoucement post to get the flag embedded within the URL.

![welcome](/assets/posts/bi0sctf2024/welcome.png)
