This is a writeup for all OSINT and cryptography challenges from Incognito 5.0 CTF 2024. A quick CTF to practice my OSINT and cryptography skills. Overall, I was very impressed with their OSINT challenges, they allowed me learn new set of OSINT tools.

## Don't panic [OSINT]
Question: One of our agent was able to get the username "GlitchyBagel42", you know what's next 🤷‍

Flag: `ictf{p1x3L_hUnT3R_My5t3ry}`

We are given a username to investigate. Using an [online username lookup tool](https://inteltechniques.com/tools/Search.html) to search up a username on different platforms.

![name1](/assets/posts/ictf2024/name1.png)

Checking the results on Google, there seems to be 0 results. However, checking the results of Bing, a Twitter account can be found associated with the specific username.

![name2](/assets/posts/ictf2024/name2.png)

![name3](/assets/posts/ictf2024/name3.png)

Analyzing the Twitter account, the first clue that can be obtained was the encoded text on the account's bio. Decoding it provides a pastebin URL.

![name4](/assets/posts/ictf2024/name4.png)

![name5](/assets/posts/ictf2024/name5.png)

However, the pastebin data seems to be password-protected. Finding more information on getting the password, several other clues can be obtaind from the account's tweets. It mentioned something about names unlocking secrets. This highly suggests that `Pixel Quokka` was the password for the pastebin data.

![name6](/assets/posts/ictf2024/name6.png)

![name7](/assets/posts/ictf2024/name7.png)

Unsurprisingly, the password was indeed correct and the pastebin data can be obtained for further analysis. Inside the pastebin data was several variations of the flag. Checking the tweets again, one of them mentioned something about the word Mystery being able solve miseries. This suggests that the flag had the word `Mystery` but obfuscated in some way.

![name8](/assets/posts/ictf2024/name8.png)

Filtering the lines with 'My', the only flag that has the worrd `My5t3ry` can be obtained.

## Email Tracker [OSINT]
Question: Our team discovered the user behind "bbburn216@gmail.com", enjoys badminton with a friend who shared a secret in their coding activities. We're eager to uncover what it is.

Flag: `ictf{L0v3_F0r_C0d3_Vi4_M41L}`

We are given a Gmail account to investigate. Using [GHunt](https://github.com/mxrch/GHunt), details about a specific Google account can be extracted if a Gmail account was provided to the tool.

```

The output shows that the user has left a review on Google maps. Analyzing the review, it seems that `Barabara Blackburn` (the user) was playing badminton with his friend `Mark`.

![name10](/assets/posts/ictf2024/name10.png)

Spending countless hours on finding `Barabara Blackburn` on different social platforms, nothing of interest can be found. However, when checking the reviews of the location, a review from `Mark` can be found.

![name11](/assets/posts/ictf2024/name11.png)

Now we have another username `markjohn777` to investigate, we can use the similar [online username lookup tool](https://inteltechniques.com/tools/Search.html) to search up his username on different platforms. Google and Bing seems to show his social media accounts that were either deactivated or deleted already. However, checking out Yandex, his CodeForce account can be found.

![name12](/assets/posts/ictf2024/name12.png)

Remembering about the description, it mentioned something about Mark leaving a secret during his coding sessions. Hence, the flag was bound to be inside his CodeForce account. Analyzing his code submissions, the last submission with ID `251004159` has the flag.

![name13](/assets/posts/ictf2024/name13.png)

## Easy [Cryptography]
Question: Delve into binary operations, where math meets magic

Flag: `ictf{X0R_Br0ught_Y0u_H3r3?}`

We are given an encoded text to investigate. The description mentioned something about binary operations, this highly suggests XOR. Since a XOR key was not provided, brute forcing the ciphertext easily provides the flag.

![key](/assets/posts/ictf2024/key.png)

## Di Dah [Cryptography]
Question: Beneath flickering lights, echoes play their games, In voltage's fluctuations, telegraph's silent claims.

Flag: `ictf{M0rs3_4nd_D1D@h_Wh1z3r3r}`

We are given an encoded text to investigate. Just by looking at the text, it seems like it was related to morse code.

```

```

Searching online about `dah-di-dit`, a morse code [manual](https://morsecode.ninja/reference/) can be found to help translate the morse code manually. Mapping the morse code with the ASCII characters, a hex encoded string can be obtained which was the flag.

## Marathon [Cryptography]
Question: How long you can go?

Flag: `ictf{D3c0d3_4ll_7h3_W@y}`

We are given an encoded text to investigate. No joke, the flag can be directly obtained after decoding with various methods.
