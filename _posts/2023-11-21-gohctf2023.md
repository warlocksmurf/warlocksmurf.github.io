This is a writeup for some forensics and OSINT challenges from Game of Hackers CTF 2023 organized by UniKL MIIT. My university sponsored several students to participate in this CTF and I was fortunate enough to be selected. I teamed up with my friends @Nathan and @Wowiee to compete against students from other Malaysian universities. In the end, we only achieved 13th place out of 30 teams, but it was still a memorable experience that tested our CTF skills and teamwork.

## The realm of Eerie Area [Forensics]
**Question:** In this mysterious realm, a malevolent force is at play. Uncover the hidden malevolence within. Figure out the dark secrets the area holds.

**Flag:** `gohunikl2023{p3ek_4_&0o}`

We are given a PCAP file to investigate. Analyzing the HTTP packets, a strange encoded GET request can be identified.

Decoding the URL with Base58 will output another URL that redirects to a file upload website.

In the website, a file called `dropmefiles.net_boo.exe` could be downloaded. However, it was discovered that the file was actually a ZIP file rather than an executable file.

```
└─$ file dropmefiles.net_boo.exe 
dropmefiles.net_boo.exe: gzip compressed data, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 10240
```

Navigating the ZIP file, the flag can be obtained within a hidden file embedded into another file.

However, the flag was actually a bait...The real flag can be obtained from the file content instead.

## Find Me [OSINT]
**Question:**

**Flag:** `gounikl2023{Y0u_F0und_M3}`

We are tasked to investigate a person given an anime picture. Reverse searching the anime picture, one of the results was a [Pinterest post](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/402016704213891878/).

There was a user `Liciela` that liked the image. Checking the user's profile, he was identified to be associated with UniKL, meaning we are on the right track.

![osint2](/assets/posts/gohctf2023/osint2.png)

Going to one of his post, we see that he also had a Hoyolab account which I assumed he used the similar name.

![osint4](/assets/posts/gohctf2023/osint4.png)

Checking his Hoyolab account, his Twitter account can be identified on his account bio. At this point, I was prepared to dive into a deep rabbit hole.

![osint5](/assets/posts/gohctf2023/osint5.png)

Going to one of his tweets, the user mentioned that he was Top 50 in Malaysia on TryHackMe.

![osint6](/assets/posts/gohctf2023/osint6.png)

When checking the monthly leaderboards on TryHackMe, we can see that his account was indeed top 1. Inside his TryHackMe account, a GitHub account was linked to it so we can proceed there now.

![osint8](/assets/posts/gohctf2023/osint8.png)

The flag can be obtained in the "Credential" repository.
