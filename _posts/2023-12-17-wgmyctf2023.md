This is a writeup for some forensics challenges from Wargames.MY CTF 2023 organized by Wargames.MY. This was also the last local CTF I've participated in 2023 with my friends @Shen and @Blugon. The CTF blew our mind as the challenges were so much more difficult than previous years. I could have done better in this CTF but I was too distracted with my final year project. I will be back stronger and hope to achieve top 10 next year.

## Compromised [Forensics]
**Question:**

**Flag:** `wgmy{d1df8b8811dbe22f3dce67ef2998f21c}`

We are given triaged Windows artifacts to investigate. Checking common Windows locations, a flag image can be identified in the user's Desktop. Checking its magic bytes, the flag image was a ZIP file instead.

The ZIP file contained the actual flag file, however, the ZIP was password-protected. Looking for ways to obtain the password, I came across the RDP cache files located in `\svc_wgmy\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Cache`. Doing research on it, this [blog](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blind-forensics-rdp-bitmap-cache-ronald-craft/) mentioned about parsing RDP bitmap cache.

Using [bmc-tools](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/bmc-tools), the RDP bitmap cache can be parsed and rebuilt into a RDP snapshot. The ZIP password was identified to be `WGMY_P4ssw0rd_N0t_V3ry_H4rd!!!` which allows us to obtain the flag file within it.

## See You [Forensics]
**Question:**

**Flag:** `wgmy{c0e22d2434fa188003be61e9fe404ea6}`

We are given a PCAP file to investigate. Unfortunately I could not solve this before the CTF ended, but I still attempted it with the help from the author. The solution was pretty cool, the challenge already mentioned about some exfiltration of a "file" to another internal computer. So the first thing was to check the IP that was sending the most requests. The IP `192.168.48.130` seem to be sending multiple UDP packets to `192.168.0.111`.

A Python script can be created to automatically extract the ports and minus 30000 from each of them.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

pcap_file = "artifact.pcapng"
tshark_filter = "udp.srcport == 38884"
output_field = "udp.dstport"
final_output = "output.txt"

try:
    tshark_command = [
        "tshark", "-r", pcap_file, "-Y", tshark_filter,
        "-T", "fields", "-e", output_field
    ]
    tshark_output = subprocess.run(
        tshark_command, text=True, capture_output=True, check=True
    ).stdout

    results = []
    for line in tshark_output.strip().splitlines():
        try:
            value = int(line.strip())
            result = value - 30000
            results.append(str(result))
        except ValueError:
            print("Error: The tshark output should contain only integers.")
            sys.exit(1)

    with open(final_output, 'w') as output_file:
        output_file.write(' '.join(results))

    print(f"Results have been written to {final_output}.")

except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error executing tshark: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)
```

Decoding the output, the flag can be obtained.
