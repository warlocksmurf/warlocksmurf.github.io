Just a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate in DFIR and blue team. You might even know me as "warlocksmurf", a CTF player for M53 and L3ak that focuses on categories like forensics, OSINT and hardware/IoT. Currently, I am part of the cybersecurity team in MoneyLion responsible for daily operational real-time monitoring and analysis of security events from multiple sources including SIEM, XDR and WAF. During my free time, I attend local meetups and events from SherpaSec, RE:HACK, and OWASP KL to network with other professionals and chat with them about the latest trends. I also pwn challenges from HTB, CyberDefenders, and BTLO to further improve my practical skills #sherlockgang.
