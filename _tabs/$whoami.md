Just a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate in DFIR and blue team. Currently a CTF player for [M53](https://twitter.com/M53CTF) and [L3ak](https://twitter.com/l3akctf), focusing on categories like forensics, OSINT and hardware/IoT. During my free time, I attend local meetups and events from SherpaSec, RE:HACK, and OWASP KL to network with other professionals and chat with them about the latest trends. I also pwn challenges from HTB, CyberDefenders, and BTLO to further improve my practical skills #sherlockgang.
